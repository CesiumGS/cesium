This is beta software.  It is incomplete and subject to change.

What's New
----------

    b5 - xxx
    ---------------
    * Breaking changes:
       * Renamed Geoscope to Cesium.  To update your code, change all Geoscope.* 
         references to Cesium.*, and reference Cesium.js instead of Geoscope.js.
       * CompositePrimitive.addGround was removed; use CompositePrimitive.add instead.
         For example, change

            primitives.addGround(polygon);

         to:

            primitives.add(polygon);

       * Moved eastNorthUpToFixedFrame and northEastDownToFixedFrame functions from Ellipsoid
         to a new Transforms object.  For example, change

            var m = ellipsoid.eastNorthUpToFixedFrame(p);

         to:

            var m = Cesium.Transforms.eastNorthUpToFixedFrame(p, ellipsoid);

       * Label properties fillStyle and strokeStyle have been renamed to fillColor and
         outlineColor; they are also now color objects instead of strings.  The label
         Color property has been removed.

         For example, change

            label.setFillStyle("red");
            label.setStrokeStyle("#FFFFFFFF");

         to:

            label.setFillColor({ red : 1.0, blue : 0.0, green : 0.0, alpha : 1.0 });
            label.setOutlineColor({ red : 1.0, blue : 1.0, green : 1.0, alpha : 1.0 });

        * Renamed Tipsify.Tipsify to Tipsify.tipsify.
        * Renamed Tipsify.CalculateACMR to Tipsify.calculateACMR.
        * Renamed LeapSecond.CompareLeapSecondDate to LeapSecond.compareLeapSecondDate.
        * Geoscope.JSONP.get is now Cesium.jsonp.
        * TWEEN is no longer globally defined, and is instead available as Cesium.Tween.
        * Chain.js functions such as run are now moved to Cesium.Chain.run, etc.
        * Geoscope.CollectionAlgorithms.binarySearch is now Cesium.binarySearch.
        * Geoscope.ContainmentTests.pointInsideTriangle2D is now Cesium.pointInsideTriangle2D.
        * Labels now correctly allow specifying fonts by non-pixel CSS units such as points, ems, etc.
        * Added Shapes.computeEllipseBoundary and updated Shapes.computeCircleBoundary to compute boundaries using arc-distance.

    b4 - 03/01/2012
    ---------------
    * Breaking changes:
       * Replaced Geoscope.SkyFromSpace object with CentralBody.showSkyAtmosphere property.
       * For mouse click and double click events, replaced event.x and event.y with event.position.
       * For mouse move events, replaced movement.startX and startY with movement.startPosition.
         Replaced movement.endX and movement.endY with movement.endPosition.
       * Scene.Pick now takes a Cartesian2 with the origin at the upper-left corner of the canvas.
         For example, code that looked like:

            scene.pick(movement.endX, scene.getCanvas().clientHeight - movement.endY);

         becomes:

             scene.pick(movement.endPosition);

    * Added SceneTransitioner to switch between 2D and 3D views.  See the new Skeleton 2D example.
    * Added CentralBody.showGroundAtmosphere to show an atmosphere on the ground.
    * Added Camera.pickEllipsoid to get the point on the globe under the mouse cursor.
    * Added Polygon.height to draw polygons at a constant altitude above the ellipsoid.

    b3 - 02/06/2012
    ---------------
    * Breaking changes:
       * Replaced Geoscope.Constants and Geoscope.Trig with Geoscope.Math.
       * Polygon
          * Replaced setColor and getColor with a material.color property.
          * Replaced setEllipsoid and getEllipsoid with an ellipsoid property.
          * Replaced setGranularity and getGranularity with a granularity property.
       * Polyline
          * Replaced setColor/getColor and setOutlineColor/getOutlineColor
            with color and outline properties.
          * Replaced setWidth/getWidth and setOutlineWidth/getOutlineWidth
            with width and outlineWidth properties.
       * Removed Geoscope.BillboardCollection.bufferUsage.  It is now
         automatically determined.
       * Removed Geoscope.Label set/get functions for shadowOffset, shadowBlur, 
         shadowColor.  These are no longer supported.
       * Renamed Scene.getTransitions to Scene.getAnimations.
       * Renamed SensorCollection to SensorVolumeCollection.
       * Replaced ComplexConicSensorVolume.material with separate materials
         for each surface: outerMaterial, innerMaterial, and capMaterial.
       * Material renames
          * TranslucentSensorVolumeMaterial to ColorMaterial.
          * DistanceIntervalSensorVolumeMaterial to DistanceIntervalMaterial.
          * TieDyeSensorVolumeMaterial to TieDyeMaterial.
          * CheckerboardSensorVolumeMaterial to CheckerboardMaterial.
          * PolkaDotSensorVolumeMaterial to DotMaterial.
          * FacetSensorVolumeMaterial to FacetMaterial.
          * BlobSensorVolumeMaterial to BlobMaterial.
    * Added new materials:
       * VerticalStripeMaterial
       * HorizontalStripeMaterial
       * DistanceIntervalMaterial
    * Added polygon material support via the new Polygon.material property.
    * Added clock angle support to ConicSensorVolume via the new maximumClockAngle 
      and minimumClockAngle properties.
    * Added a rectangular sensor, RectangularPyramidSensorVolume.
    * Changed custom sensor to connect direction points using the
      sensor's radius; previously, points were connected with a line.
    * Improved performance and memory usage of BillboardCollection and LabelCollection.
    * Added more mouse events.
    * Added Sandbox examples for new features.

    b2 - 12/01/2011
    ---------------
    * Added complex conic and custom sensor volumes, and various materials
      to change their appearance.  See the new Sensor folder in the Sandbox.
    * Added modelMatrix property to primitives to render them in a local
      reference frame.  See the polyline example in the Sandbox.
    * Added eastNorthUpToFixedFrame() and northEastDownToFixedFrame() 
      to Ellipsoid to create local reference frames.
    * Added CameraFlightController to zoom smoothly from one point to another.
      See the new camera examples in the Sandbox.
    * Added row and column assessors to Matrix2, Matrix3, and Matrix4.
    * Added Scene, which reduces the amount of code required to use
      Geoscope.  See the Skeleton.  We recommend using this instead of 
      explicitly calling update() and render() for individual or composite 
      primitives.  Existing code will need minor changes:
       * Calls to Context.pick() should be replaced with Scene.pick().
       * Primitive constructors no longer require a context argument.
       * Primitive update() and render() functions now require a
         context argument.  However, when using the new Scene object,
         these functions do not need to be called directly.
       * TextureAtlas should no longer be created directly; instead,
         call Scene.getContext().createTextureAtlas().
    * Other breaking changes:
       * Camera get/set functions, e.g., getPosition/setPosition were 
         replaced with properties, e.g., position.
       * Replaced CompositePrimitive, Polygon, and Polyline getShow/setShow 
         functions with a show property.
       * Replaced Polyline, Polygon, BillboardCollection, and LabelCollection
         getBufferUsage/setBufferUsage functions with a bufferUsage property.
       * Changed colors used by billboards, labels, polylines, and polygons.
         Previously, components were named r, g, b, and a.  They are now
         red, green, blue, and alpha.  Previously, each component's range
         was [0, 255].  The range is now [0, 1] floating point.  For example,

            color : { r : 0, g : 255, b : 0, a : 255 }

         becomes

            color : { red : 0.0, green : 1.0, blue : 0.0, alpha : 1.0 }

    b1 - 09/19/2011
    ----------------
    * Added Shapes.computeCircleBoundary to compute circles.  See the Sandbox.
    * Changed the EventHandler constructor function to take the Geoscope
      canvas, which ensures the mouse position is correct regardless of
      the canvas' position on the page.  Code that previously looked like:

         var handler = new Geoscope.EventHandler();

      should now look like:

         var handler = new Geoscope.EventHandler(canvas);

    * Context.Pick no longer requires clamping the x and y arguments.
      Code that previously looked like:

         var pickedObject = context.pick(primitives, us, 
            Math.max(x, 0.0), Math.max(context.getCanvas().clientHeight - y, 0.0));

      can now look like:

         var pickedObject = context.pick(primitives, us, 
            x, context.getCanvas().clientHeight - y);

    * Changed Polyline.setWidth and Polyline.setOutlineWidth to clamp the
      width to the WebGL implementation limit instead of throwing an exception.
      Code that previously looked like:

         var maxWidth = context.getMaximumAliasedLineWidth();
         polyline.setWidth(Math.min(5, maxWidth));
         polyline.setOutlineWidth(Math.min(10, maxWidth));

      can now look like:

         polyline.setWidth(5);
         polyline.setOutlineWidth(10);

    * Improved the Sandbox:
       * Code in the editor is now evaluated as you type for quick prototyping.
       * Highlighting a Geoscope type in the editor and clicking the doc button
         in the toolbar now brings up the reference help for that type.
    * BREAKING CHANGE:  The Context constructor-function now takes an element 
      instead of an ID.  Code that previously looked like:    

         var context = new Geoscope.Context("glCanvas");
         var canvas = context.getCanvas();

      should now look like:

         var canvas = document.getElementById("glCanvas");
         var context = new Geoscope.Context(canvas);

    b0 - 08/31/2011
    ----------------
    * Added new Sandbox and Skeleton examples.  The sandbox contains example code
      for common tasks.  The skeleton is a bare-bones application for building upon.
      Most sandbox code examples can be copy and pasted directly into the skeleton.
    * Added Geoscope.Polygon for drawing polygons on the globe.
    * Added Context.pick to pick objects in one line of code.
    * Added bringForward, bringToFront, sendBackward, and sendToBack functions to 
      CompositePrimitive to control the render-order for ground primitives.
    * Added getShow/setShow functions to Polyline and CompositePrimitive.
    * Added new camera control and event types including CameraFreeLookEventHandler, 
      CameraSpindleEventHandler, and EventHandler.
    * Replaced Ellipsoid.toCartesian3 with Ellipsoid.toCartesian.
    * update and updateForPick functions no longer require a UniformState argument.

    a6 - 08/05/2011
    ----------------
    * Added support for lines using Geoscope.Polyline.  See the Sandbox example.
    * Made CompositePrimitive, LabelCollection, and BillboardCollection have
      consistent function names, including a new contains() function.
    * Improved reference documentation layout.

    a5 - 07/22/2011
    ----------------
    * Flushed out CompositePrimitive, TimeStandard, and LeapSecond types.
    * Improved support for browsers using ANGLE (Windows Only).

    a4 - 07/15/2011
    ----------------
    * Added Geoscope.TimeStandard for handling TAI and UTC time standards.
    * Added Geoscope.Quaternion, which is a foundation for future camera control.
    * Added initial version of Geoscope.PrimitiveCollection to simplify rendering.
    * Prevented billboards/labels near the surface from getting cut off by the globe.
    * See the Sandbox for example code.
    * Added more reference documentation for labels.

    a3 - 07/08/2011
    ----------------
    * Added Geoscope.LabelCollection for drawing text.
    * Added Geoscope.JulianDate and Geoscope.TimeConstants for proper time handling.
    * See the Sandbox example for how to use the new labels and Julian date.

    a2 - 07/01/2011
    ----------------
    * Added Geoscope.ViewportQuad and Geoscope.Rectangle (foundations for 2D map).
    * Improved the visual quality of cloud shadows.

    a1 - 06/24/2011
    ----------------
    * Added SunPosition type to compute the sun position for a julian date.
    * Simplified picking.  See the mouse move event in the Sandbox example.
    * Cartographic2 and Cartographic3 are now mutable types.
    * Added reference documentation for billboards.

    a0 - 06/17/2011
    ----------------
    * Initial Release.


Instructions
------------

To use Cesium in your application, build it and reference Build/Cesium.js in 
your html file.  A simple example application is located at Build/Examples/Skeleton.


Full Details
------------

1. Install the latest drivers for your video card.

2. Install the latest version of Chrome or Firefox.

3. Ensure your system supports WebGL by visiting our WebGL report:

    http://analyticalgraphicsinc.github.com/webglreport/

4. Cesium is composed of the following directories and files:

    * Build - Pre-built Cesium, and HTML documentation.  The 
              documentation is incomplete and contains many TODOs.
              To get a feel for the library, look at the documentation 
              for BillboardCollection.

    * Documentation - Files used to build documentation.

    * Cesium - Source code for the entire library, including tests 
                 (specs) and examples.  When using eclipse to develop 
                 Cesium, this is the project directory imported into 
                 the workspace.

    * Images - Images used by examples.

    * ThirdParty - Third-party code used in Cesium.

    * Tools - Mostly tools used to build Cesium.

    * LICENSE - Third-party copyright information.

    * Readme.txt - This file.

    The Ant build script, which you are welcome to base your own build process on, 
    is located at:  Cesium/build.xml.

5. In order for the tests linked from the portal page (Build/index.html)
   to work correctly, the page must be accessed via a web server.  Any web 
   server should do, but here are commands for configuring Apache on Ubuntu 
   Linux:

       * sudo apt-get install apache2
       * sudo ln -s ~/cesium/Build /var/www/cesium

6. To open the portal page, browse to http://localhost/cesium.  Use the 
   links to run the tests and examples, and view the documentation.

7. To include Cesium in your own application, simply include 

        Build/Cesium.js

   in your html file.  See Build/Examples/Skeleton/index.html 
   for an example.
