# Change Log

### 1.112 - 2023-12-01

#### @cesium/engine

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed terrain lockups in `requestTileGeometry` by ensuring promise handling aligns with CesiumJS's expectations. [#11630](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/11630)
- Corrected JSDoc and Typescript definitions that marked optional arguments as required in `Cesium3dTileset.fromIonAssetId` [#11623](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/11623), and `IonImageryProvider.fromAssetId` [#11624](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/11624)

### 1.111 - 2023-11-01

#### @cesium/engine

##### Additions :tada:

- `BingMapsImageryProvider.fromUrl` now takes an optional `mapLayer` parameter which is a string that maps directly to the [mapLayer template parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/rest-services/imagery/get-imagery-metadata#template-parameters) specified in the Bing Maps documentation.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- By default, `createGooglePhotorealistic3DTileset` no longer shows credits on screen but links to them instead, as this is compliant with the minimum required attribution. To restore this behavior, pass the option `showCreditsOnScreen: true`. [#11589](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/11589)
- Fixed an issue with polygon hole rendering. [#11583](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/11583)
- Fixed error with rhumb lines that have a 0 degree heading. [#11573](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/11573)
- Fixed `czm_normal`, `czm_normal3D`, `czm_inverseNormal`, and `czm_inverseNormal3D` for cases where the model matrix has non-uniform scale. [#11553](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/11553)
- Fixed issue with clustered labels when `dataSource.show` was toggled. [#11560](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/11560)
- Fixed inconsistant clustering when `dataSource.show` was toggled. [#11560](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/11560)

### 1.110.1 - 2023-10-25

#### @cesium/engine

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- CesiumJS no longer ships with a demo Google Maps API key. `GoogleMaps.defaultApiKey` is no longer defined by default.
- `createGooglePhotorealistic3DTileset` by default now provides tiles via Cesium ion if the `GoogleMaps.defaultApiKey` is not set.
- If you wish to continue to use your own Google Maps API key, you can go back to the previous behavior:

  ```javascript
  Cesium.GoogleMaps.defaultApiKey = "your-api-key";

  const tileset = await Cesium.createGooglePhotorealistic3DTileset();
  viewer.scene.primitives.add(tileset));
  ```

### 1.110 - 2023-10-02

### 1.102 - 2023-02-01

#### @cesium/engine

#### Major Announcements :loudspeaker:

- CesiumJS now defaults to using a WebGL2 context for rendering. WebGL2 is widely supported on all platforms and this results in better feature support across devices, especially mobile.
  - WebGL1 is supported. If WebGL2 is not available, CesiumJS will automatically fall back to WebGL1.
  - In order to work in a WebGL2 context, any custom materials, custom primitives or custom shaders will need to be upgraded to use GLSL 300.
  - Otherwise to request a WebGL 1 context, set `requestWebgl1` to `true` when providing `ContextOptions` as shown below:
    ```js
    const viewer = new Viewer("cesiumContainer", {
      contextOptions: {
        requestWebgl1: true,
      },
    });
    ```

### 1.101 - 2023-01-02

#### Major Announcements :loudspeaker:

- Starting with version 1.102, CesiumJS will default to using a WebGL2 context for rendering. WebGL2 is widely supported on all platforms and this change will result in better feature support across devices, especially mobile.
  - WebGL1 will still be supported. If WebGL2 is not available, CesiumJS will automatically fall back to WebGL1.
  - In order to work in a WebGL2 context, any custom materials, custom primitive or custom shaders will need to be upgraded to use GLSL 300.
  - Otherwise to request a WebGL 1 context, set `requestWebgl1` to `true` when providing `ContextOptions` as shown below:
    ```js
    const viewer = new Viewer("cesiumContainer", {
      contextOptions: {
        requestWebgl1: true,
      },
    });

#### Major Announcements :loudspeaker:

- CesiumJS has switched to a new architecture for loading glTF models and tilesets to enable:
  - User-defined GLSL shaders via [`CustomShader`](Documentation/CustomShaderGuide/README.md)
  - Support for [3D Tiles Next](https://cesium.com/blog/2021/11/10/introducing-3d-tiles-next/) metadata extensions: [`EXT_structural_metadata`](https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/proposal-EXT_structural_metadata/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_structural_metadata), [`EXT_mesh_features`](https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/proposal-EXT_mesh_features/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_features) and [`EXT_instance_features`](https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_instance_features)
  - Support for [`EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing)
  - Support for [`EXT_meshopt_compression`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_meshopt_compression)
  - Texture caching across different tiles
  - Numerous bug fixes
- Usage notes for the new glTF architecture:
  - Those using `ModelExperimental.fromGltf()` should now use `Model.fromGltf()`.
  - The `enableModelExperimental` flag was removed, as tilesets and entities always use the new architecture.
  - The new implementation of `Model` uses the same public API as before, so no other changes are necessary.

#### Breaking Changes :mega:

- glTF 1.0 assets are no longer fully supported. glTF 1.0 techniques are converted to PBR materials where possible, but more complex techniques will no longer function correctly. If custom GLSL shaders are needed, use `CustomShader` instead. [#10648](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/10648)
- The glTF 2.0 extension `KHR_techniques_webgl` and `KHR_materials_common` are also no longer fully supported. Materials are converted to PBR materials where possible.
- Support for rendering instanced models on the CPU has been removed.
- `Model.gltf`, `Model.basePath`, `Model.pendingTextureLoads` (properties), and `Model.dequantizeInShader` (constructor option) have been removed.
- `ModelMesh` and `ModelMaterial` have been removed.
- `new Model()` is an internal constructor and must not be used directly. Use `Model.fromGltf()` instead. [#10778](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/10778)

- `Model` now supports back face culling for point clouds. [#10703](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/10703)
- Export asset files such as CSS in `package.json`, allowing bundlers to import without additional configuration. [#9212](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/9212)
- The `sideEffects` field in `package.json` is now specified, allowing more conservative bundlers like Webpack to enable tree shaking by default. [#10714](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/10714)
- Model entities now support `CustomShader`. [#10747](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/10747)

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed bug with `Viewer.flyTo` where camera could go underground when target is an `Entity` with `ModelGraphics` with `HeightReference.CLAMP_TO_GROUND` or `HeightReference.RELATIVE_TO_GROUND`. [#10631](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/10631)

##### Major Announcements :loudspeaker:

- Built `Cesium.js` is no longer AMD format. This may or may not be a breaking change depending on how you use Cesium in your app. See our [blog post](https://cesium.com/blog/2022/07/19/build-tooling-updates-coming-to-cesiumjs/) for the full details. [#10399](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/10399)
  - Built `Cesium.js` has gone from `12.5MB` to `8.4MB` unminified and from `4.3MB` to `3.6MB` minified. `Cesium.js.map` has gone from `22MB` to `17.2MB`.
  - If you were ingesting individual ESM-style modules from the combined file `Build/Cesium/Cesium.js` or `Build/CesiumUnminified/Cesium.js`, instead use `Build/Cesium/index.js` or `Build/CesiumUnminified/index.js` respectively.
  - Using ESM from `Source` will require a bundler to resolve third party node dependencies.
  - `CESIUM_BASE_URL` should be set to either `Build/Cesium` or `Build/CesiumUnminified`.

### 1.72 - 2020-08-03

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- CesiumJS no longer ships with a default Mapbox access token and Mapbox imagery layers have been removed from the `BaseLayerPicker` defaults. If you are using `MapboxImageryProvider` or `MapboxStyleImageryProvider`, use `options.accessToken` when initializing the imagery provider.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added support for glTF multi-texturing via `TEXCOORD_1`. [#9075](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/9075)

##### Deprecated :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- `MapboxApi.defaultAccessToken` was deprecated and will be removed in CesiumJS 1.73. Pass your access token directly to the MapboxImageryProvider or MapboxStyleImageryProvider constructors.
- `BingMapsApi` was deprecated and will be removed in CesiumJS 1.73. Pass your access key directly to the BingMapsImageryProvider or BingMapsGeocoderService constructors.

### 1.71 - 2020-07-01

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- Updated `WallGeometry` to respect the order of positions passed in, instead of making the positions respect a counter clockwise winding order. This will only affect the look of walls with an image material. If this changed the way your wall is drawing, reverse the order of the positions. [#8955](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8955/)

##### Additions :tada:

- Fixed animation widget SVG icons not appearing in iOS 13.5.1. [#8993](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8993)

### 1.70.1 - 2020-06-10

##### Additions :tada:

- Add a `toString` method to the `Resource` class in case an instance gets logged as a string. [#8722](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/8722)
- Exposed `Transforms.rotationMatrixFromPositionVelocity` method from Cesium's private API. [#8927](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/8927)

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed JSDoc and TypeScript type definitions for `EllipsoidGeodesic` which incorrectly listed `result` as required. [#8904](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8904)
- Fixed JSDoc and TypeScript type definitions for `EllipsoidTangentPlane.fromPoints`, which takes an array of `Cartesian3`, not a single instance. [#8928](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8928)
- Fixed JSDoc and TypeScript type definitions for `EntityCollection.getById` and `CompositeEntityCollection.getById`, which can both return undefined. [#8928](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8928)
- Fixed JSDoc and TypeScript type definitions for `Viewer` options parameters.
- Fixed a memory leak where some 3D Tiles requests were being unintentionally retained after the requests were cancelled. [#8843](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8843)
- Fixed a bug with handling of PixelFormat's flipY. [#8893](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8893)

### 1.70.0 - 2020-06-01

##### Major Announcements :loudspeaker:

- All Cesium ion users now have access to Cesium OSM Buildings - a 3D buildings layer covering the entire world built with OpenStreetMap building data, available as 3D Tiles. Read more about it [on our blog](https://cesium.com/blog/2020/06/01/cesium-osm-buildings/).
  - [Explore it on Sandcastle](https://sandcastle.cesium.com/index.html?src=Cesium%20OSM%20Buildings.html).
  - Add it to your CesiumJS app: `viewer.scene.primitives.add(Cesium.createOsmBuildings())`.
  - Contains per-feature data like building name, address, and much more. [Read more about the available properties](https://cesium.com/content/cesium-osm-buildings/).
- CesiumJS now ships with official TypeScript type definitions! [#8878](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8878)
  - If you import CesiumJS as a module, the new definitions will automatically be used by TypeScript and related tooling.
  - If you import individual CesiumJS source files directly, you'll need to add `"types": ["cesium"]` in your tsconfig.json in order for the definitions to be used.
  - If you’re using your own custom definitions and you’re not yet ready to switch, you can delete `Source/Cesium.d.ts` after install.
  - See our [blog post](https://cesium.com/blog/2020/06/01/cesiumjs-tsd/) for more information and a technical overview of how it all works.
- CesiumJS now supports underground rendering with globe translucency! [#8726](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8726)
  - Added options for controlling globe translucency through the new [`GlobeTranslucency`](https://cesium.com/learn/cesiumjs/ref-doc/GlobeTranslucency.html) object including front face alpha, back face alpha, and a translucency rectangle.
  - Added `Globe.undergroundColor` and `Globe.undergroundColorAlphaByDistance` for controlling how the back side of the globe is rendered when the camera is underground or the globe is translucent. [#8867](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8867)
  - Improved camera controls when the camera is underground. [#8811](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8811)
  - Sandcastle examples: [Globe Translucency](https://sandcastle.cesium.com/?src=Globe%20Translucency.html), [Globe Interior](https://sandcastle.cesium.com/?src=Globe%20Interior.html), and [Underground Color](https://sandcastle.cesium.com/?src=Underground%20Color.html&label=All)

##### Additions :tada:

- Our API reference documentation has received dozens of fixes and improvements, largely due to the TypeScript effort.
- Added `Cesium3DTileset.extensions` to get the extensions property from the tileset JSON. [#8829](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8829)
- Added `Camera.completeFlight`, which causes the current camera flight to immediately jump to the final destination and call its complete callback. [#8788](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8788)
- Added `nightAlpha` and `dayAlpha` properties to `ImageryLayer` to control alpha separately for the night and day sides of the globe. [#8868](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8868)
- Added `SkyAtmosphere.perFragmentAtmosphere` to switch between per-vertex and per-fragment atmosphere shading. [#8866](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8866)
- Added a new sandcastle example to show how to add fog using a `PostProcessStage` [#8798](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8798)

- Supported `#rgba` and `#rrggbbaa` formats in `Color.fromCssColorString`. [8873](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8873)

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that could cause rendering of a glTF model to become corrupt when switching from a Uint16 to a Uint32 index buffer to accomodate new vertices added for edge outlining. [#8820](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8820)
- Fixed a bug where a removed billboard could prevent changing of the `TerrainProvider`. [#8766](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8766)
- Fixed an issue with 3D Tiles point cloud styling where `${feature.propertyName}` and `${feature["propertyName"]}` syntax would cause a crash. Also fixed an issue where property names with non-alphanumeric characters would crash. [#8785](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8785)
- Fixed a bug where `DebugCameraPrimitive` was ignoring the near and far planes of the `Camera`. [#8848](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/8848)
- Fixed sky atmosphere artifacts below the horizon. [#8866](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8866)
- Fixed ground primitives in orthographic mode. [#5110](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/5110)
- Fixed the depth plane in orthographic mode. This improves the quality of polylines and other primitives that are rendered near the horizon. [8858](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8858)

### 1.69.0 - 2020-05-01

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- The property `Scene.sunColor` has been removed. Use `scene.light.color` and `scene.light.intensity` instead. [#8774](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8774)
- Removed `isArray`. Use the native `Array.isArray` function instead. [#8779](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8779)

##### Additions :tada:

- Added `RequestScheduler` to the public API; this allows users to have more control over the requests made by CesiumJS. [#8384](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/8384)
- Added support for high-quality edges on solid geometry in glTF models. [#8776](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8776)
- Added `Scene.cameraUnderground` for checking whether the camera is underneath the globe. [#8765](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8765)

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed several problems with polylines when the logarithmic depth buffer is enabled, which is the default on most systems. [#8706](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8706)
- Fixed a bug with very long view ranges requiring multiple frustums even with the logarithmic depth buffer enabled. Previously, such scenes could resolve depth incorrectly. [#8727](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8727)
- Fixed an issue with glTF skinning support where an optional property `skeleton` was considered required by Cesium. [#8175](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/8175)
- Fixed an issue with clamping of non-looped glTF animations. Subscribers to animation `update` events should expect one additional event firing as an animation stops. [#7387](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/7387)
- Geometry instance floats now work for high precision floats on newer iOS devices. [#8805](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8805)
- Fixed a bug where the elevation contour material's alpha was not being applied. [#8749](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8749)
- Fix potential memory leak when destroying `CesiumWidget` instances. [#8591](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8591)
- Fixed displaying the Cesium ion icon when running in an Android, iOS or UWP WebView. [#8758](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8758)

### 1.68.0 - 2020-04-01

##### Additions :tada:

- Added basic underground rendering support. When the camera is underground the globe will be rendered as a solid surface and underground entities will not be culled. [#8572](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/8572)
- The `CesiumUnminified` build now includes sourcemaps. [#8572](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8659)
- Added glTF `STEP` animation interpolation. [#8786](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8786)
- Added the ability to edit CesiumJS shaders on-the-fly using the [SpectorJS](https://spector.babylonjs.com/) Shader Editor. [#8608](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8608)

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Cesium can now be used in Node.JS 12 and later, with or without `--experimental-modules`. It can still be used in earlier versions as well. [#8572](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8659)
- Interacting with the Cesium canvas will now blur the previously focused element. This prevents unintended modification of input elements when interacting with the globe. [#8662](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8662)
- `TileMapServiceImageryProvider` will now force `minimumLevel` to 0 if the `tilemapresource.xml` metadata request fails and the `rectangle` is too large for the given detail level [#8448](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/8448)
- Fixed ground atmosphere rendering when using a smaller ellipsoid. [#8683](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/8683)
- Fixed globe incorrectly occluding objects when using a smaller ellipsoid. [#7124](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/7124)
- Fixed a regression introduced in 1.67 which caused overlapping colored ground geometry to have visual artifacts. [#8694](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8694)
- Fixed a clipping problem when viewing a polyline up close with the logarithmic depth buffer enabled, which is the default on most systems. [#8703](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8703)

### 1.67.0 - 2020-03-02

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- `Cesium3DTileset.skipLevelOfDetail` is now `false` by default. [#8631](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8631)
- glTF models are now rendered using the `LEQUALS` depth test function instead of `LESS`. This means that when geometry overlaps, the _later_ geometry will be visible above the earlier, where previously the opposite was true. We believe this is a more sensible default, and makes it easier to render e.g. outlined buildings with glTF. [#8646](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8646)

##### Additions :tada:

- Massively improved performance of clamped Entity ground geometry with dynamic colors. [#8630](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8630)
- Added `Entity.tileset` for loading a 3D Tiles tileset via the Entity API using the new `Cesium3DTilesetGraphics` class. [#8580](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8580)
- Added `tileset.uri`, `tileset.show`, and `tileset.maximumScreenSpaceError` properties to CZML processing for loading 3D Tiles. [#8580](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8580)
- Added `Color.lerp` for linearly interpolating between two RGB colors. [#8607](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8607)
- `CesiumTerrainProvider` now supports terrain tiles using a `WebMercatorTilingScheme` by specifying `"projection": "EPSG:3857"` in `layer.json`. It also now supports numbering tiles from the North instead of the South by specifying `"scheme": "slippyMap"` in `layer.json`. [#8563](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8563)
- Added basic support for `isNaN`, `isFinite`, `null`, and `undefined` in the 3D Tiles styling GLSL backend for point clouds. [#8621](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8621)
- Added `sizeInMeters` to `ParticleSystem`. [#7746](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7746)

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that caused large, nearby geometry to be clipped when using a logarithmic depth buffer, which is the default on most systems. [#8600](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8600)
- Fixed a bug where tiles would not load if the camera was tracking a moving tileset. [#8598](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8598)
- Fixed a bug where applying a new 3D Tiles style during a flight would not update all existing tiles. [#8622](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8622)
- Fixed a bug where Cartesian vectors could not be packed to typed arrays [#8568](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8568)
- Updated knockout from 3.5.0 to 3.5.1. [#8424](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8424)
- Cesium's local development server now works in Node 12 & 13 [#8648](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8648)

##### Deprecated :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- The `isArray` function has been deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.69. Use the native `Array.isArray` function instead. [#8526](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8526)

### 1.66.0 - 2020-02-03

##### Deprecated :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- The property `Scene.sunColor` has been deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.69. Use `scene.light.color` and `scene.light.intensity` instead. [#8493](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8493)

##### Additions :tada:

- `useBrowserRecommendedResolution` flag in `Viewer` and `CesiumWidget` now defaults to `true`. This ensures Cesium rendering is fast and smooth by default across all devices. Set it to `false` to always render at native device resolution instead at the cost of performance on under-powered devices. [#8548](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8548)
- Cesium now creates a WebGL context with a `powerPreference` value of `high-performance`. Some browsers use this setting to enable a second, more powerful, GPU. You can set it back to `default`, or opt-in to `low-power` mode, by passing the context option when creating a `Viewer` or `CesiumWidget` instance:

```js
var viewer = new Viewer("cesiumContainer", {
  contextOptions: {
    webgl: {
      powerPreference: "default",
    },
  },
});
```

- Added more customization to Cesium's lighting system. [#8493](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8493)
  - Added `Light`, `DirectionalLight`, and `SunLight` classes for creating custom light sources.
  - Added `Scene.light` for setting the scene's light source, which defaults to a `SunLight`.
  - Added `Globe.dynamicAtmosphereLighting` for enabling lighting effects on atmosphere and fog, such as day/night transitions. It is true by default but may be set to false if the atmosphere should stay unchanged regardless of the scene's light direction.
  - Added `Globe.dynamicAtmosphereLightingFromSun` for using the sun direction instead of the scene's light direction when `Globe.dynamicAtmosphereLighting` is enabled. See the moonlight example in the [Lighting Sandcastle example](https://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Apps/Sandcastle/?src=Lighting.html).
  - Primitives and the globe are now shaded with the scene light's color.
- Updated SampleData models to glTF 2.0. [#7802](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/7802)
- Added `Globe.showSkirts` to support the ability to hide terrain skirts when viewing terrain from below the surface. [#8489](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8489)
- Added `minificationFilter` and `magnificationFilter` options to `Material` to control texture filtering. [#8473](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8473)
- Updated [earcut](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut) to 2.2.1. [#8528](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8528)
- Added a font cache to improve label performance. [#8537](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8537)

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug where the camera could go underground during mouse navigation. [#8504](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8504)
- Fixed a bug where rapidly updating a `PolylineCollection` could result in an `instanceIndex` is out of range error. [#8546](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8546)
- Fixed issue where `RequestScheduler` double-counted image requests made via `createImageBitmap`. [#8162](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/8162)
- Reduced Cesium bundle size by avoiding unnecessarily importing `Cesium3DTileset` in `Picking.js`. [#8532](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8532)
- Fixed a bug where files with backslashes were not loaded in KMZ files. [#8533](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8533)
- Fixed WebGL warning message about `EXT_float_blend` being implicitly enabled. [#8534](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8534)
- Fixed a bug where toggling point cloud classification visibility would result in a grey screen on Linux / Nvidia. [#8538](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8538)
- Fixed a bug where a point in a `PointPrimitiveCollection` was rendered in the middle of the screen instead of being clipped. [#8542](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8542)
- Fixed a crash when deleting and re-creating polylines from CZML. `ReferenceProperty` now returns undefined when the target entity or property does not exist, instead of throwing. [#8544](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8544)
- Fixed terrain tile picking in the Cesium Inspector. [#8567](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8567)
- Fixed a crash that could occur when an entity was deleted while the corresponding `Primitive` was being created asynchronously. [#8569](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8569)
- Fixed a crash when calling `camera.lookAt` with the origin (0, 0, 0) as the target. This could happen when looking at a tileset with the origin as its center. [#8571](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8571)
- Fixed a bug where `camera.viewBoundingSphere` was modifying the `offset` parameter. [#8438](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8438)
- Fixed a crash when creating a plane with both position and normal on the Z-axis. [#8576](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8576)
- Fixed `BoundingSphere.projectTo2D` when the bounding sphere’s center is at the origin. [#8482](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8482)

### 1.65.0 - 2020-01-06

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- `OrthographicFrustum.getPixelDimensions`, `OrthographicOffCenterFrustum.getPixelDimensions`, `PerspectiveFrustum.getPixelDimensions`, and `PerspectiveOffCenterFrustum.getPixelDimensions` now require a `pixelRatio` argument before the `result` argument. The previous function definition has been deprecated since 1.63. [#8320](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8320)
- The function `Matrix4.getRotation` has been renamed to `Matrix4.getMatrix3`. `Matrix4.getRotation` has been deprecated since 1.62. [#8183](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8183)
- `createTileMapServiceImageryProvider` and `createOpenStreetMapImageryProvider` have been removed. Instead, pass the same options to `new TileMapServiceImageryProvider` and `new OpenStreetMapImageryProvider` respectively. The old functions have been deprecated since 1.62. [#8174](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8174)

##### Additions :tada:

- Decreased Web Workers bundle size by a factor of 10, from 8384KB (2624KB gzipped) to 863KB (225KB gzipped). This makes Cesium load faster, especially on low-end devices and slower network connections.
- Added full UTF-8 support to labels, greatly improving support for non-latin alphabets and emoji. [#7280](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7280)
- Added `"type": "module"` to package.json to take advantage of native ES6 module support in newer versions of Node.js. This also enables module-based front-end development for tooling that relies on Node.js module resolution.
- The combined `Build/Cesium/Cesium.js` and `Build/CesiumUnminified/Cesium.js` have been upgraded from IIFE to UMD modules that support IIFE, AMD, and commonjs.
- Added `pixelRatio` parameter to `OrthographicFrustum.getPixelDimensions`, `OrthographicOffCenterFrustum.getPixelDimensions`, `PerspectiveFrustum.getPixelDimensions`, and `PerspectiveOffCenterFrustum.getPixelDimensions`. Pass in `scene.pixelRatio` for dimensions in CSS pixel units or `1.0` for dimensions in native device pixel units. [#8237](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8237)

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed css pixel usage for polylines, point clouds, models, primitives, and post-processing. [#8113](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/8113)
- Fixed a bug where `scene.sampleHeightMostDetailed` and `scene.clampToHeightMostDetailed` would not resolve in request render mode. [#8281](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/8281)
- Fixed seam artifacts when log depth is disabled, `scene.globe.depthTestAgainstTerrain` is false, and primitives are under the globe. [#8205](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8205)
- Fix dynamic ellipsoids using `innerRadii`, `minimumClock`, `maximumClock`, `minimumCone` or `maximumCone`. [#8277](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8277)
- Fixed rendering billboard collections containing more than 65536 billboards. [#8325](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8325)

##### Deprecated :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- `OrthographicFrustum.getPixelDimensions`, `OrthographicOffCenterFrustum.getPixelDimensions`, `PerspectiveFrustum.getPixelDimensions`, and `PerspectiveOffCenterFrustum.getPixelDimensions` now take a `pixelRatio` argument before the `result` argument. The previous function definition will no longer work in 1.65. [#8237](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/8237)

### 1.62 - 2019-10-01

##### Deprecated :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- `createTileMapServiceImageryProvider` and `createOpenStreetMapImageryProvider` have been deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.65. Instead, pass the same options to `new TileMapServiceImageryProvider` and `new OpenStreetMapImageryProvider` respectively.
- The function `Matrix4.getRotation` has been deprecated and renamed to `Matrix4.getMatrix3`. `Matrix4.getRotation` will be removed in version 1.65.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added ability to create partial ellipsoids using both the Entity API and CZML. New ellipsoid geometry properties: `innerRadii`, `minimumClock`, `maximumClock`, `minimumCone`, and `maximumCone`. This affects both `EllipsoidGeometry` and `EllipsoidOutlineGeometry`. See the updated [Sandcastle example](https://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Apps/Sandcastle/?src=Partial%20Ellipsoids.html&label=Geometries). [#5995](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/5995)
- Added `useBrowserRecommendedResolution` flag to `Viewer` and `CesiumWidget`. When true, Cesium renders at CSS pixel resolution instead of native device resolution. This replaces the workaround in the 1.61 change list. [8215](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/8215)
- Added `TileMapResourceImageryProvider` and `OpenStreetMapImageryProvider` classes to improve API consistency: [#4812](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/4812)

### 1.60 - 2019-08-01

##### Additions :tada:

- Reworked label rendering to use signed distance fields (SDF) for crisper text. [#7730](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7730)
- Added a [new Sandcastle example](https://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Build/Apps/Sandcastle/?src=Labels%20SDF.html) to showcase the new SDF labels.
- Added support for polygon holes to CZML. [#7991](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7991)
- Added `totalScale` property to `Label` which is the total scale of the label taking into account the label's scale and the relative size of the desired font compared to the generated glyph size.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed crash when using ArcGIS terrain with clipping planes. [#7998](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7998)
- `PolygonGraphics.hierarchy` now converts constant array values to a `PolygonHierarchy` when set, so code that accesses the value of the property can rely on it always being a `PolygonHierarchy`.
- Fixed a bug with lengthwise texture coordinates in the first segment of ground polylines, as observed in some WebGL implementations such as Chrome on Linux. [#8017](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/8017)

### 1.58.1 - 2018-06-03

_This is an npm-only release to fix a publishing issue_.

### 1.58 - 2019-06-03

##### Additions :tada:

- Added support for new `BingMapsStyle` values `ROAD_ON_DEMAND` and `AERIAL_WITH_LABELS_ON_DEMAND`. The older versions of these, `ROAD` and `AERIAL_WITH_LABELS`, have been deprecated by Bing. [#7808](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7808)
- Added syntax to delete data from existing properties via CZML. [#7818](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7818)
- Added `checkerboard` material to CZML. [#7845](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7845)
- `BingMapsImageryProvider` now uses `DiscardEmptyTileImagePolicy` by default to detect missing tiles as zero-length responses instead of inspecting pixel values. [#7810](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7810)
- Added support for the [AGI_articulations](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Vendor/AGI_articulations) vendor extension of glTF 2.0 to the Model primitive graphics API. [#7835](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7835)
- Reduce the number of Bing transactions and ion Bing sessions used when destroying and recreating the same imagery layer to 1. [#7848](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7848)

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed an edge case where Cesium would provide ion access token credentials to non-ion servers if the actual asset entrypoint was being hosted by ion. [#7839](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7839)
- Fixed a bug that caused Cesium to request non-existent tiles for terrain tilesets lacking tile availability, i.e. a `layer.json` file.
- Fixed memory leak when removing entities that had a `HeightReference` of `CLAMP_TO_GROUND` or `RELATIVE_TO_GROUND`. This includes when removing a `DataSource`.
- Fixed 3D Tiles credits not being shown in the data attribution box. [#7877](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7877)

### 1.57 - 2019-05-01

##### Additions :tada:

- Improved 3D Tiles streaming performance, resulting in ~67% camera tour load time reduction, ~44% camera tour load count reduction. And for general camera movement, ~20% load time reduction with ~27% tile load count reduction. Tile load priority changed to focus on loading tiles in the center of the screen first. Added the following tileset optimizations, which unless stated otherwise are enabled by default. [#7774](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7774)
  - Added `Cesium3DTileset.cullRequestsWhileMoving` option to ignore requests for tiles that will likely be out-of-view due to the camera's movement when they come back from the server.
  - Added `Cesium3DTileset.cullRequestsWhileMovingMultiplier` option to act as a multiplier when used in culling requests while moving. Larger is more aggressive culling, smaller less aggressive culling.
  - Added `Cesium3DTileset.preloadFlightDestinations` option to preload tiles at the camera's flight destination while the camera is in flight.
  - Added `Cesium3DTileset.preferLeaves` option to prefer loading of leaves. Good for additive refinement point clouds. Set to `false` by default.
  - Added `Cesium3DTileset.progressiveResolutionHeightFraction` option to load tiles at a smaller resolution first. This can help get a quick layer of tiles down while full resolution tiles continue to load.
  - Added `Cesium3DTileset.foveatedScreenSpaceError` option to prioritize loading tiles in the center of the screen.
  - Added `Cesium3DTileset.foveatedConeSize` option to control the cone size that determines which tiles are deferred for loading. Tiles outside the cone are potentially deferred.
  - Added `Cesium3DTileset.foveatedMinimumScreenSpaceErrorRelaxation` option to control the starting screen space error relaxation for tiles outside the foveated cone.
  - Added `Cesium3DTileset.foveatedInterpolationCallback` option to control how screen space error threshold is interpolated for tiles outside the foveated cone.
  - Added `Cesium3DTileset.foveatedTimeDelay` option to control how long in seconds to wait after the camera stops moving before deferred tiles start loading in.
- Added new parameter to `PolylineGlowMaterial` called `taperPower`, that works similar to the existing `glowPower` parameter, to taper the back of the line away. [#7626](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7626)
- Added `Cesium3DTileset.preloadWhenHidden` tileset option to preload tiles when `tileset.show` is false. Loads tiles as if the tileset is visible but does not render them. [#7774](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7774)
- Added support for the `KHR_texture_transform` glTF extension. [#7549](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7549)
- Added functions to remove samples from `SampledProperty` and `SampledPositionProperty`. [#7723](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7723)
- Added support for color-to-alpha with a threshold on imagery layers. [#7727](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7727)
- Add CZML processing for `heightReference` and `extrudedHeightReference` for geoemtry types that support it.
- `CesiumMath.toSNorm` documentation changed to reflect the function's implementation. [#7774](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7774)
- Added `CesiumMath.normalize` to convert a scalar value in an arbitrary range to a scalar in the range [0.0, 1.0]. [#7774](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7774)

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed an error when loading the same glTF model in two separate viewers. [#7688](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/7688)
- Fixed an error where `clampToHeightMostDetailed` or `sampleHeightMostDetailed` would crash if entities were created when the promise resolved. [#7690](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7690)
- Fixed an issue with compositing merged entity availability. [#7717](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/7717)
- Fixed an error where many imagery layers within a single tile would cause parts of the tile to render as black on some platforms. [#7649](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/7649)
- Fixed a bug that could cause terrain with a single, global root tile (e.g. that uses `WebMercatorTilingScheme`) to be culled unexpectedly in some views. [#7702](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/7702)
- Fixed a problem where instanced 3D models were incorrectly lit when using physically based materials. [#7775](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/7775)
- Fixed a bug where glTF models with certain blend modes were rendered incorrectly in browsers that support ImageBitmap. [#7795](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/7795)

### 1.56.1 - 2019-04-02

##### Additions :tada:

- `Resource.fetchImage` now takes a `preferImageBitmap` option to use `createImageBitmap` when supported to move image decode off the main thread. This option defaults to `false`.

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- The following breaking changes are relative to 1.56. The `Resource.fetchImage` behavior is now identical to 1.55 and earlier.
  - Changed `Resource.fetchImage` back to return an `Image` by default, instead of an `ImageBitmap` when supported. Note that an `ImageBitmap` cannot be flipped during texture upload. Instead, set `flipY : true` during fetch to flip it.
  - Changed the default `flipY` option in `Resource.fetchImage` to false. This only has an effect when ImageBitmap is used.

### 1.56 - 2019-04-01

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- `Resource.fetchImage` now returns an `ImageBitmap` instead of `Image` when supported. This allows for decoding images while fetching using `createImageBitmap` to greatly speed up texture upload and decrease frame drops when loading models with large textures. [#7579](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7579)
- `Cesium3DTileStyle.style` now has an empty `Object` as its default value, instead of `undefined`. [#7567](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/7567)
- `Scene.clampToHeight` now takes an optional `width` argument before the `result` argument. [#7693](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7693)
- In the `Resource` class, `addQueryParameters` and `addTemplateValues` have been removed. Please use `setQueryParameters` and `setTemplateValues` instead. [#7695](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/7695)

##### Deprecated :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- `Resource.fetchImage` now takes an options object. Use `resource.fetchImage({ preferBlob: true })` instead of `resource.fetchImage(true)`. The previous function definition will no longer work in 1.57. [#7579](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7579)

##### Additions :tada:

- Added support for touch and hold gesture. The touch and hold delay can be customized by updating `ScreenSpaceEventHandler.touchHoldDelayMilliseconds`. [#7286](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7286)
- `Resource.fetchImage` now has a `flipY` option to vertically flip an image during fetch & decode. It is only valid when `ImageBitmapOptions` is supported by the browser. [#7579](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7579)
- Added `backFaceCulling` and `normalShading` options to `PointCloudShading`. Both options are only applicable for point clouds containing normals. [#7399](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7399)
- `Cesium3DTileStyle.style` reacts to updates and represents the current state of the style. [#7567](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/7567)

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed the value for `BlendFunction.ONE_MINUS_CONSTANT_COLOR`. [#7624](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7624)
- Fixed `HeadingPitchRoll.pitch` being `NaN` when using `.fromQuaternion` due to a rounding error for pitches close to +/- 90°. [#7654](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7654)
- Fixed a type of crash caused by the camera being rotated through terrain. [#6783](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/6783)
- Fixed an error in `Resource` when used with template replacements using numeric keys. [#7668](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7668)
- Fixed an error in `Cesium3DTilePointFeature` where `anchorLineColor` used the same color instance instead of cloning the color [#7686](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7686)

### 1.55 - 2019-03-01

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- `czm_materialInput.slope` is now an angle in radians between 0 and pi/2 (flat to vertical), rather than a projected length 1 to 0 (flat to vertical).

##### Additions :tada:

- Updated terrain and imagery rendering, resulting in terrain/imagery loading ~33% faster and using ~33% less data [#7061](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7061)
- `czm_materialInput.aspect` was added as an angle in radians between 0 and 2pi (east, north, west to south).
- Added CZML `arcType` support for `polyline` and `polygon`, which supersedes `followSurface`. `followSurface` is still supported for compatibility with existing documents. [#7582](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7582)

  - `Scene.sphericalHarmonicCoefficients` is an array of 9 `Cartesian3` spherical harmonics coefficients for the diffuse irradiance of all PBR models in the scene.
  - The `specularEnvironmentMaps` and `sphericalHarmonicCoefficients` properties of `Model` and `Cesium3DTileset` can be used to override the values from the scene for specific models and tilesets.
  - The `luminanceAtZenith` property of `Model` and `Cesium3DTileset` adjusts the luminance of the procedural image-based lighting.
- Double click away from an entity to un-track it [#7285](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7285)

### 1.50 - 2018-10-01

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- Clipping planes on tilesets now use the root tile's transform, or the root tile's bounding sphere if a transform is not defined. [#7034](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/7034)
  - This is to make clipping planes' coordinates always relative to the object they're attached to. So if you were positioning the clipping planes as in the example below, this is no longer necessary:
  ```javascript
  clippingPlanes.modelMatrix = Cesium.Transforms.eastNorthUpToFixedFrame(
    tileset.boundingSphere.center
  );
  ```
  - This also fixes several issues with clipping planes not using the correct transform for tilesets with children.

##### Deprecated :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- Support for 3D Tiles `content.url` is deprecated to reflect updates to the [3D Tiles spec](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/pull/301). Use `content.uri instead`. Support for `content.url` will remain for backwards compatibility. [#6744](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6744)
- Support for the 3D Tiles pre-version 1.0 Batch Table Hierarchy is deprecated to reflect updates to the [3D Tiles spec](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/pull/301). Use the [`3DTILES_batch_table_hierarchy`](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/tree/main/extensions/3DTILES_batch_table_hierarchy) extension instead. Support for the deprecated batch table hierarchy will remain for backwards compatibility. [#6780](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6780)
- `PostProcessStageLibrary.createLensFlarStage` is deprecated due to misspelling and will be removed in Cesium 1.49. Use `PostProcessStageLibrary.createLensFlareStage` instead.

##### Fixes :wrench:

### 1.47 - 2018-07-02

##### Highlights :sparkler:

- Added support for polylines on terrain [#6689](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6689) [#6615](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6615)
- Added `heightReference` and `extrudedHeightReference` properties to `CorridorGraphics`, `EllipseGraphics`, `PolygonGraphics` and `RectangleGraphics`. [#6717](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6717)
- `PostProcessStage` has a `selected` property which is an array of primitives used for selectively applying a post-process stage. [#6476](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6476)

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- glTF 2.0 models corrected to face +Z forwards per specification. Internally Cesium uses +X as forward, so a new +Z to +X rotation was added for 2.0 models only. To fix models that are oriented incorrectly after this change:
  - If the model faces +X forwards update the glTF to face +Z forwards. This can be done by loading the glTF in a model editor and applying a 90 degree clockwise rotation about the up-axis. Alternatively, add a new root node to the glTF node hierarchy whose `matrix` is `[0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]`.
  - Apply a -90 degree rotation to the model's heading. This can be done by setting the model's `orientation` using the Entity API or from within CZML. See [#6738](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6738) for more details.
- Dropped support for directory URLs when loading tilesets to match the updated [3D Tiles spec](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/issues/272). [#6502](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/6502)
- KML and GeoJSON now use `PolylineGraphics` instead of `CorridorGraphics` for polylines on terrain. [#6706](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6706)

##### Additions :tada:

- Added support for polylines on terrain [#6689](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6689) [#6615](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6615)
  - Use the `clampToGround` option for `PolylineGraphics` (polyline entities).
  - Requires depth texture support (`WEBGL_depth_texture` or `WEBKIT_WEBGL_depth_texture`), otherwise `clampToGround` will be ignored. Use `Entity.supportsPolylinesOnTerrain` to check for support.
  - Added `GroundPolylinePrimitive` and `GroundPolylineGeometry`.
- `PostProcessStage` has a `selected` property which is an array of primitives used for selectively applying a post-process stage. [#6476](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6476)
  - The `PostProcessStageLibrary.createBlackAndWhiteStage` and `PostProcessStageLibrary.createSilhouetteStage` have per-feature support.
- Added CZML support for `zIndex` with `corridor`, `ellipse`, `polygon`, `polyline` and `rectangle`. [#6708](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6708)
- Added CZML `clampToGround` option for `polyline`. [#6706](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6706)
- Added support for `RTC_CENTER` property in batched 3D model tilesets to conform to the updated [3D Tiles spec](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/issues/263). [#6488](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/6488)
- Added `heightReference` and `extrudedHeightReference` properties to `CorridorGraphics`, `EllipseGraphics`, `PolygonGraphics` and `RectangleGraphics`. [#6717](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6717)
  - This can be used in conjunction with the `height` and/or `extrudedHeight` properties to clamp the geometry to terrain or set the height relative to terrain.
  - Note, this will not make the geometry conform to terrain. Extruded geoemtry that is clamped to the ground will have a flat top will sinks into the terrain at the base.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that caused Cesium to be unable to load local resources in Electron. [#6726](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6726)
- Fixed a bug causing crashes with custom vertex attributes on `Geometry` crossing the IDL. Attributes will be barycentrically interpolated. [#6644](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6644)

- Fixed a bug with Draco encoded i3dm tiles, and loading two Draco models with the same url. [#6668](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/6668)
- Fixed a bug caused by creating a polygon with positions at the same longitude/latitude position but different heights [#6731](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6731)
- Fixed terrain clipping when the camera was close to flat terrain and was using logarithmic depth. [#6701](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6701)
- Fixed KML bug that constantly requested the same image if it failed to load. [#6710](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6710)
- Improved billboard and label rendering so they no longer sink into terrain when clamped to ground. [#6621](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6621)
- Fixed an issue where KMLs containing a `colorMode` of `random` could return the exact same color on successive calls to `Color.fromRandom()`.
- `Iso8601.MAXIMUM_VALUE` now formats to a string which can be parsed by `fromIso8601`.
- Fixed material support when using an image that is already loaded [#6729](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6729)

### 1.46.1 - 2018-06-01

- This is an npm only release to fix the improperly published 1.46.0. There were no code changes.

### 1.46 - 2018-06-01

##### Highlights :sparkler:

- Added support for materials on terrain entities (entities with unspecified `height`) and `GroundPrimitives`. [#6393](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6393)
- Added a post-processing framework. [#5615](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/5615)
- Added `zIndex` for ground geometry, including corridor, ellipse, polygon and rectangle entities. [#6362](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6362)

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- `ParticleSystem` no longer uses `forces`. [#6510](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6510)
- `Particle` no longer uses `size`, `rate`, `lifeTime`, `life`, `minimumLife`, `maximumLife`, `minimumWidth`, `minimumHeight`, `maximumWidth`, and `maximumHeight`. [#6510](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6510)
- Removed `Scene.copyGlobeDepth`. Globe depth will now be copied by default when supported. [#6393](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6393)
- The default `classificationType` for `GroundPrimitive`, `CorridorGraphics`, `EllipseGraphics`, `PolygonGraphics` and `RectangleGraphics` is now `ClassificationType.TERRAIN`. If you wish the geometry to color both terrain and 3D tiles, pass in the option `classificationType: Cesium.ClassificationType.BOTH`.
- Removed support for the `options` argument for `Credit` [#6373](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/6373). Pass in an html string instead.
- glTF 2.0 models corrected to face +Z forwards per specification. Internally Cesium uses +X as forward, so a new +Z to +X rotation was added for 2.0 models only. [#6632](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6632)

##### Deprecated :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- The `Scene.fxaa` property has been deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.47. Use `Scene.postProcessStages.fxaa.enabled`.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added support for materials on terrain entities (entities with unspecified `height`) and `GroundPrimitives`. [#6393](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6393)
  - Only available for `ClassificationType.TERRAIN` at this time. Adding a material to a terrain `Entity` will cause it to behave as if it is `ClassificationType.TERRAIN`.
  - Requires depth texture support (`WEBGL_depth_texture` or `WEBKIT_WEBGL_depth_texture`), so materials on terrain entities and `GroundPrimitives` are not supported in Internet Explorer.
  - Best suited for notational patterns and not intended for precisely mapping textures to terrain - for that use case, use `SingleTileImageryProvider`.
- Added `GroundPrimitive.supportsMaterials` and `Entity.supportsMaterialsforEntitiesOnTerrain`, both of which can be used to check if materials on terrain entities and `GroundPrimitives` is supported. [#6393](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6393)
- Added a post-processing framework. [#5615](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/5615)
  - Added `Scene.postProcessStages` which is a collection of post-process stages to be run in order.
    - Has a built-in `ambientOcclusion` property which will apply screen space ambient occlusion to the scene and run before all stages.
    - Has a built-in `bloom` property which applies a bloom filter to the scene before all other stages but after the ambient occlusion stage.
    - Has a built-in `fxaa` property which applies Fast Approximate Anti-aliasing (FXAA) to the scene after all other stages.
  - Added `PostProcessStageLibrary` which contains several built-in stages that can be added to the collection.
  - Added `PostProcessStageComposite` for multi-stage post-processes like depth of field.
  - Added a new Sandcastle label `Post Processing` to showcase the different built-in post-process stages.
- Added `zIndex` for ground geometry, including corridor, ellipse, polygon and rectangle entities. [#6362](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6362)
- Added `Rectangle.equalsEpsilon` for comparing the equality of two rectangles [#6533](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6533)

- Fixed race condition causing intermittent crash when changing geometry show value [#3061](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/3061)
- `ProviderViewModel`s with no category are displayed in an untitled group in `BaseLayerPicker` instead of being labeled as `'Other'` [#6574](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6574)
- Fixed a bug causing intermittent crashes with clipping planes due to uninitialized textures. [#6576](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6576)
- Added a workaround for clipping planes causing a picking shader compilation failure for gltf models and 3D Tilesets in Internet Explorer [#6575](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/6575)
- Allowed Bing Maps servers with a subpath (instead of being at the root) to work correctly. [#6597](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6597)
- Added support for loading of Draco compressed glTF assets in IE11 [#6404](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/6404)
- Fixed polygon outline when using `perPositionHeight` and `extrudedHeight`. [#6595](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/6595)
- Fixed broken links in documentation of `createTileMapServiceImageryProvider`. [#5818](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/5818)
- Transitioning from 2 touches to 1 touch no longer triggers a new pan gesture. [#6479](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6479)

### 1.45 - 2018-05-01

##### Major Announcements :loudspeaker:

- We've launched Cesium ion! Read all about it in our [blog post](https://cesium.com/blog/2018/05/01/get-your-cesium-ion-community-account/).
- Cesium now uses ion services by default for base imagery, terrain, and geocoding. A demo key is provided, but to use them in your own apps you must [sign up](https://cesium.com/ion/signup) for a free ion Commmunity account.

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- `ClippingPlaneCollection` now uses `ClippingPlane` objects instead of `Plane` objects. [#6498](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6498)
- Cesium no longer ships with a demo Bing Maps API key.
- `BingMapsImageryProvider` is no longer the default base imagery layer. (Bing imagery itself is still the default, however it is provided through Cesium ion)
- `BingMapsGeocoderService` is no longer the default geocoding service.
- If you wish to continue to use your own Bing API key for imagery and geocoding, you can go back to the old default behavior by constructing the Viewer as follows:
  ```javascript
  Cesium.BingMapsApi.defaultKey = "yourBingKey";
  var viewer = new Cesium.Viewer("cesiumContainer", {
    imageryProvider: new Cesium.BingMapsImageryProvider({
      url: "https://dev.virtualearth.net",
    }),
    geocoder: [
      new Cesium.CartographicGeocoderService(),
      new Cesium.BingMapsGeocoderService(),
    ],
  });
  ```

##### Deprecated :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- `Particle.size`, `ParticleSystem.rate`, `ParticleSystem.lifeTime`, `ParticleSystem.life`, `ParticleSystem.minimumLife`, and `ParticleSystem.maximumLife` have been renamed to `Particle.imageSize`, `ParticleSystem.emissionRate`, `ParticleSystem.lifetime`, `ParticleSystem.particleLife`, `ParticleSystem.minimumParticleLife`, and `ParticleSystem.maximumParticleLife`. Use of the `size`, `rate`, `lifeTime`, `life`, `minimumLife`, and `maximumLife` parameters is deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.46.
- `ParticleSystem.forces` array has been switched out for singular function `ParticleSystems.updateCallback`. Use of the `forces` parameter is deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.46.
- Any width and height variables in `ParticleSystem` will no longer be individual components. `ParticleSystem.minimumWidth` and `ParticleSystem.minimumHeight` will now be `ParticleSystem.minimumImageSize`, `ParticleSystem.maximumWidth` and `ParticleSystem.maximumHeight` will now be `ParticleSystem.maximumImageSize`, and `ParticleSystem.width` and `ParticleSystem.height` will now be `ParticleSystem.imageSize`. Use of the `minimumWidth`, `minimumHeight`, `maximumWidth`, `maximumHeight`, `width`, and `height` parameters is deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.46.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added option `logarithmicDepthBuffer` to `Scene`. With this option there is typically a single frustum using logarithmic depth rendered. This increases performance by issuing less draw calls to the GPU and helps to avoid artifacts on the connection of two frustums. [#5851](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/5851)
- When a log depth buffer is supported, the frustum near and far planes default to `0.1` and `1e10` respectively.
- Added `IonGeocoderService` and made it the default geocoding service for the `Geocoder` widget.
- Added `createWorldImagery` which provides Bing Maps imagery via a Cesium ion account.
- Added `PeliasGeocoderService`, which provides geocoding via a [Pelias](https://pelias.io) server.
- Added the ability for `BaseLayerPicker` to group layers by category. `ProviderViewModel.category` was also added to support this feature.

- For all classes/functions that take a `Resource` instance, all additional parameters that are part of the `Resource` class have been removed. This generally includes `proxy`, `headers` and `query` parameters. [#6368](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6368)
- All low level load functions including `loadArrayBuffer`, `loadBlob`, `loadImage`, `loadJson`, `loadJsonp`, `loadText`, `loadXML` and `loadWithXhr` have been removed. Please use the equivalent `fetch` functions on the `Resource` class. [#6368](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6368)

##### Deprecated :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- `ClippingPlaneCollection` is now supported in Internet Explorer, so `ClippingPlaneCollection.isSupported` has been deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.45.
- `ClippingPlaneCollection` should now be used with `ClippingPlane` objects instead of `Plane`. Use of `Plane` objects has been deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.45.
- `Credit` now takes an `html` and `showOnScreen` parameters instead of an `options` object. Use of the `options` parameter is deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.46.
- `Credit.text`, `Credit.imageUrl` and `Credit.link` properties have all been deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.46. Use `Credit.html` to retrieve the credit content.
- `Credit.hasImage` and `Credit.hasLink` functions have been deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.46.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added a new Sandcastle label, `New in X.X` which will include all new Sandcastle demos added for the current release. [#6384](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/6384)
- Added support for glTF models with [Draco geometry compression](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_draco_mesh_compression/README.md). [#5120](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/5120)
  - Added `dequantizeInShader` option parameter to `Model` and `Model.fromGltf` to specify if Draco compressed glTF assets should be dequantized on the GPU.
- Added support for ordering in `DataSourceCollection`. [#6316](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6316)
  - All ground geometry from one `DataSource` will render in front of all ground geometry from another `DataSource` in the same collection with a lower index.
  - Use `DataSourceCollection.raise`, `DataSourceCollection.lower`, `DataSourceCollection.raiseToTop` and `DataSourceCollection.lowerToBottom` functions to change the ordering of a `DataSource` in the collection.
- `ClippingPlaneCollection` updates [#6201](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6201):
  - Removed the 6-clipping-plane limit.
  - Added support for Internet Explorer.
  - Added a `ClippingPlane` object to be used with `ClippingPlaneCollection`.
  - Added 3D Tiles use-case to the Terrain Clipping Planes Sandcastle.

- Fixed a bug where Cesium would fail to load under Node.js. [#6177](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6177)

### 1.42 - 2018-02-01

##### Highlights :sparkler:

- Added experimental support for [3D Tiles Vector and Geometry data](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/tree/vctr/TileFormats/VectorData). ([#4665](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/4665))
- Added optional mode to reduce CPU usage. See [Improving Performance with Explicit Rendering](https://cesium.com/blog/2018/01/24/cesium-scene-rendering-performance/). ([#6115](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6115))
- Added experimental `CesiumIon` utility class for working with the Cesium ion beta API. [#6136](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6136)
- Major refactor of URL handling. All classes that take a url parameter, can now take a Resource or a String. This includes all imagery providers, all terrain providers, `Cesium3DTileset`, `KMLDataSource`, `CZMLDataSource`, `GeoJsonDataSource`, `Model`, and `Billboard`.

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- The clock does not animate by default. Set the `shouldAnimate` option to `true` when creating the Viewer to enable animation.

##### Deprecated :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- For all classes/functions that can now take a `Resource` instance, all additional parameters that are part of the `Resource` class have been deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.44. This generally includes `proxy`, `headers` and `query` parameters.
- All low level load functions including `loadArrayBuffer`, `loadBlob`, `loadImage`, `loadJson`, `loadJsonp`, `loadText`, `loadXML` and `loadWithXhr` have been deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.44. Please use the equivalent `fetch` functions on the `Resource` class.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added experimental support for [3D Tiles Vector and Geometry data](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/tree/vctr/TileFormats/VectorData) ([#4665](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/4665)). The new and modified Cesium APIs are:
  - `Cesium3DTileStyle` has expanded to include styling point features. See the [styling specification](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/tree/vector-tiles/Styling#vector-data) for details.
  - `Cesium3DTileFeature` can modify `color` and `show` properties for polygon, polyline, and geometry features.
  - `Cesium3DTilePointFeature` can modify the styling options for a point feature.
- Added optional mode to reduce CPU usage. [#6115](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6115)
  - `Scene.requestRenderMode` enables a mode which will only request new render frames on changes to the scene, or when the simulation time change exceeds `scene.maximumRenderTimeChange`.
  - `Scene.requestRender` will explicitly request a new render frame when in request render mode.
  - Added `Scene.preUpdate` and `Scene.postUpdate` events that are raised before and after the scene updates respectively. The scene is always updated before executing a potential render. Continue to listen to `Scene.preRender` and `Scene.postRender` events for when the scene renders a frame.
  - Added `CreditDisplay.update`, which updates the credit display before a new frame is rendered.
  - Added `Globe.imageryLayersUpdatedEvent`, which is raised when an imagery layer is added, shown, hidden, moved, or removed on the globe.
- Added `Cesium3DTileset.classificationType` to specify if a tileset classifies terrain, another 3D Tiles tileset, or both. This only applies to vector, geometry and batched 3D model tilesets. The limitations on the glTF contained in the b3dm tile are:
  - `POSITION` and `_BATCHID` semantics are required.
  - All indices with the same batch id must occupy contiguous sections of the index buffer.
  - All shaders and techniques are ignored. The generated shader simply multiplies the position by the model-view-projection matrix.
  - The only supported extensions are `CESIUM_RTC` and `WEB3D_quantized_attributes`.
  - Only one node is supported.
  - Only one mesh per node is supported.
  - Only one primitive per mesh is supported.
- Added geometric-error-based point cloud attenuation and eye dome lighting for point clouds using replacement refinement. [#6069](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6069)
- Updated `Viewer.zoomTo` and `Viewer.flyTo` to take a `Cesium3DTileset` as a target. [#6104](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6104)
- Added `shouldAnimate` option to the `Viewer` constructor to indicate if the clock should begin animating on startup. [#6154](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6154)
- Added `Cesium3DTileset.ellipsoid` determining the size and shape of the globe. This can be set at construction and defaults to a WGS84 ellipsoid.
- Added `Plane.projectPointOntoPlane` for projecting a `Cartesian3` position onto a `Plane`. [#6092](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6092)
- Added `Cartesian3.projectVector` for projecting one vector to another. [#6093](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6093)
- Added `Cesium3DTileset.tileFailed` event that will be raised when a tile fails to load. The object passed to the event listener will have a url and message property. If there are no event listeners, error messages will be logged to the console. [#6088](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6088)
- Added `AttributeCompression.zigZagDeltaDecode` which will decode delta and ZigZag encoded buffers in place.
- Added `pack` and `unpack` functions to `OrientedBoundingBox` for packing to and unpacking from a flat buffer.
- Added support for vertex shader uniforms when `tileset.colorBlendMode` is `MIX` or `REPLACE`. [#5874](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/5874)
- Added `ClippingPlaneCollection.isSupported` function for checking if rendering with clipping planes is supported.[#6084](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6084)
- Added `Cartographic.toCartesian` to convert from `Cartographic` to `Cartesian3`. [#6163](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6163)
- Added `BoundingSphere.volume` for computing the volume of a `BoundingSphere`. [#6069](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6069)
- Added new file for the Cesium [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). [#6129](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/6129)

  - `KMLDataSource`
    - Point and Model features will always respect `altitudeMode`.
    - Added `clampToGround` property. When `true`, clamps `Polygon`, `LineString` and `LinearRing` features to the ground if their `altitudeMode` is `clampToGround`. For this case, lines use a corridor instead of a polyline.
  - `GeoJsonDataSource`
    - Points with a height will be drawn at that height; otherwise, they will be clamped to the ground.
    - Added `clampToGround` property. When `true`, clamps `Polygon` and `LineString` features to the ground. For this case, lines use a corridor instead of a polyline.

This only affects polygons created synchronously with `options.perPositionHeight = false` when the positions have a non-zero height and the same positions are used for multiple entities. In this case, make a copy of the `Cartesian3` values used for the polygon positions.
- Deprecated
  - Deprecated `KmlDataSource` taking a proxy object. It will throw an exception in 1.21. It now should take a `options` object with required `camera` and `canvas` parameters.

- Reduced the amount of CPU memory used by terrain by ~25% in Chrome.
- Added a Sandcastle example to "star burst" overlapping billboards and labels.
- Added `VRButton` which is a simple, single-button widget that toggles VR mode. It is off by default. To enable the button, set the `vrButton` option to `Viewer` to `true`. Only Cardboard for mobile is supported. More VR devices will be supported when the WebVR API is more stable.
- Added `Scene.useWebVR` to switch the scene to use stereoscopic rendering.
- Cesium now honors `window.devicePixelRatio` on browsers that support the CSS `imageRendering` attribute. This greatly improves performance on mobile devices and high DPI displays by rendering at the browser-recommended resolution. This also reduces bandwidth usage and increases battery life in these cases. To enable the previous behavior, use the following code:
  ```javascript
  if (Cesium.FeatureDetection.supportsImageRenderingPixelated()) {
    viewer.resolutionScale = window.devicePixelRatio;
  }
  ```
- `GroundPrimitive` now supports batching geometry for better performance.

- Fixed a bug that prevented WMS feature picking from working with THREDDS XML and msGMLOutput in Internet Explorer 11.
- Added `Scene.useDepthPicking` to enable or disable picking using the depth buffer. [#3390](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/3390)
- Added `BoundingSphere.fromEncodedCartesianVertices` to create bounding volumes from parallel arrays of the upper and lower bits of `EncodedCartesian3`s.
- Added helper functions: `getExtensionFromUri`, `getAbsoluteUri`, and `Math.logBase`.
- Added `Rectangle.union` and `Rectangle.expand`.
- TMS support now works with newer versions of gdal2tiles.py generated layers. `createTileMapServiceImageryProvider`. Tilesets generated with older gdal2tiles.py versions may need to have the `flipXY : true` option set to load correctly.

### 1.17 - 2016-01-04

- Breaking changes
  - Removed `Camera.viewRectangle`. Use `Camera.setView({destination: rectangle})` instead.

See the new Sandcastle example: [CZML Model - Node Transformations](http://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Apps/Sandcastle/index.html?src=CZML%20Model%20-%20Node%20Transformations.html&label=CZML). [#3316](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/3316)
- Added `Globe.tileLoadProgressEvent`, which is raised when the length of the tile load queue changes, enabling incremental loading indicators.
- Added support for msGMLOutput and Thredds server feature information formats to `GetFeatureInfoFormat` and `WebMapServiceImageryProvider`.
- Added dynamic `enableFeaturePicking` toggle to all ImageryProviders that support feature picking.
- Fixed disappearing terrain while fog is active. [#3335](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/3335)

- Added `Matrix4.fromTranslationRotationScale`.
- Added `NodeTransformationProperty`, which is a `Property` value that is defined by independent `translation`, `rotation`, and `scale` `Property` instances.
- Added `PropertyBag`, which is a `Property` whose value is a key-value mapping of property names to the computed value of other properties.
- Added `ModelGraphics.runAnimations` which is a boolean `Property` indicating if all model animations should be started after the model is loaded.
- Added `ModelGraphics.nodeTransformations` which is a `PropertyBag` of `TranslationRotationScale` properties to be applied to a loaded model.
- Added CZML support for new `runAnimations` and `nodeTransformations` properties on the `model` packet.

### 1.16 - 2015-12-01

- Deprecated
  - Deprecated `HeightmapTessellator`. It will be removed in 1.17.
  - Deprecated `TerrainMesh`. It will be removed in 1.17.
  - Deprecated `OpenStreetMapImageryProvider`. It will be removed in 1.18. Use `createOpenStreetMapImageryProvider` instead.
- Improved terrain performance by up to 35%. Added support for fog near the horizon, which improves performance by rendering less terrain tiles and reduces terrain tile requests. This is enabled by default. See `Scene.fog` for options. [#3154](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/3154)
- Added terrain exaggeration. Enabled on viewer creation with the exaggeration scalar as the `terrainExaggeration` option.
- Added support for incrementally loading textures after a Model is ready. This allows the Model to be visible as soon as possible while its textures are loaded in the background.

- Added `ImageryProvider.readyPromise` and `TerrainProvider.readyPromise` and implemented it in all terrain and imagery providers. This is a promise which resolves when `ready` becomes true and rejected if there is an error during initialization. [#3175](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/3175)
- Fixed an issue where the sun texture is not generated correctly on some mobile devices. [#3141](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/3141)

- Fixed glTF implementation to read the version as a string as per the specification and to correctly handle backwards compatibility for axis-angle rotations in glTF 0.8 models.
- Fixed a bug in the deprecated `jsonp` that prevented it from returning a promise. Its replacement, `loadJsonp`, was unaffected.
- Fixed a bug where loadWithXhr would reject the returned promise with successful HTTP responses (2xx) that weren't 200.

### 1.15 - 2015-11-02

- Breaking changes
  - Deleted old `<subfolder>/package.json` and `*.profile.js` files, not used since Cesium moved away from a Dojo-based build years ago. This will allow future compatibility with newer systems like Browserify and Webpack.
- Deprecated
  - Deprecated `Camera.viewRectangle`. It will be removed in 1.17. Use `Camera.setView({destination: rectangle})` instead.
  - The following options to `Camera.setView` have been deprecated and will be removed in 1.17:
    - `position`. Use `destination` instead.
    - `positionCartographic`. Convert to a `Cartesian3` and use `destination` instead.
    - `heading`, `pitch` and `roll`. Use `orientation.heading/pitch/roll` instead.
  - Deprecated `CESIUM_binary_glTF` extension support for glTF models. [KHR_binary_glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/Khronos/KHR_binary_glTF) should be used instead. `CESIUM_binary_glTF` will be removed in 1.18. Reconvert models using the online [model converter](http://cesiumjs.org/convertmodel.html).
  - Deprecated `RectanglePrimitive`. It will be removed in 1.17. Use `RectangleGeometry` or `Entity.rectangle` instead.
  - Deprecated `EllipsoidPrimitive`. It will be removed in 1.17. Use `EllipsoidGeometry` or `Entity.ellipsoid` instead.
  - Made `EllipsoidPrimitive` private, use `EllipsoidGeometry` or `Entity.ellipsoid` instead.
  - Deprecated `BoxGeometry.minimumCorner` and `BoxGeometry.maximumCorner`. These will be removed in 1.17. Use `BoxGeometry.minimum` and `BoxGeometry.maximum` instead.
  - Deprecated `BoxOutlineGeometry.minimumCorner` and `BoxOutlineGeometry.maximumCorner`. These will be removed in 1.17. Use `BoxOutlineGeometry.minimum` and `BoxOutlineGeometry.maximum` instead.
  - Deprecated `OrthographicFrustum.getPixelSize`. It will be removed in 1.17. Use `OrthographicFrustum.getPixelDimensions` instead.
  - Deprecated `PerspectiveFrustum.getPixelSize`. It will be removed in 1.17. Use `PerspectiveFrustum.getPixelDimensions` instead.
  - Deprecated `PerspectiveOffCenterFrustum.getPixelSize`. It will be removed in 1.17. Use `PerspectiveOffCenterFrustum.getPixelDimensions` instead.

  - Deprecated `jsonp`. It will be removed in 1.17. Use `loadJsonp` instead.
- Added support for the [glTF 1.0](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/specification/README.md) draft specification.
- Added support for the glTF extensions [KHR_binary_glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/Khronos/KHR_binary_glTF) and [KHR_materials_common](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/KHR_materials_common/extensions/Khronos/KHR_materials_common).
- Decreased GPU memory usage in `BillboardCollection` and `LabelCollection` by using WebGL instancing.
- Added CZML examples to Sandcastle. See the new CZML tab.
- Changed `Camera.setView` to take the same parameter options as `Camera.flyTo`. `options.destination` takes a rectangle, `options.orientation` works with heading/pitch/roll or direction/up, and `options.endTransform` was added. [#3100](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/3100)
- Fixed token issue in `ArcGisMapServerImageryProvider`.
- `ImageryLayerFeatureInfo` now has an `imageryLayer` property, indicating the layer that contains the feature.
- Made `TileMapServiceImageryProvider` and `CesiumTerrainProvider` work properly when the provided base url contains query parameters and fragments.
- The WebGL setting of `failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat` now defaults to `false`, which is the WebGL default. This improves compatibility with out-of-date drivers and remote desktop sessions. Cesium will run slower in these cases instead of simply failing to load. [#3108](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/3108)
- Fixed the issue where the camera inertia takes too long to finish causing the camera move events to fire after it appears to. [#2839](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/2839)
- Make KML invalid coordinate processing match Google Earth behavior. [#3124](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/3124)
- Added `BoxOutlineGeometry.fromAxisAlignedBoundingBox` and `BoxGeometry.fromAxisAlignedBoundingBox` functions.
- Switched to [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for all build tasks. `Java` and `ant` are no longer required to develop Cesium. [#3106](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/3106)
- Updated `requirejs` from 2.1.9 to 2.1.20. [#3107](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/3107)

### 1.14 - 2015-10-01

- Fixed issues causing the terrain and sky to disappear when the camera is near the surface. [#2415](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/2415) and [#2271](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/2271)
- Changed the `ScreenSpaceCameraController.minimumZoomDistance` default from `20.0` to `1.0`.
- Added `Billboard.sizeInMeters`. `true` sets the billboard size to be measured in meters; otherwise, the size of the billboard is measured in pixels. Also added support for billboard `sizeInMeters` to entities and CZML.
- Fixed a bug in `AssociativeArray` that would cause unbounded memory growth when adding and removing lots of items.
- Provided a workaround for Safari 9 where WebGL constants can't be accessed through `WebGLRenderingContext`. Now constants are hard-coded in `WebGLConstants`. [#2989](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/2989)
- Added a workaround for Chrome 45, where the first character in a label with a small font size would not appear. [#3011](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/3011)
- Added `subdomains` option to the `WebMapTileServiceImageryProvider` constructor.
- Added `subdomains` option to the `WebMapServiceImageryProvider` constructor.
- Fix zooming in 2D when tracking an object. The zoom was based on location rather than the tracked object. [#2991](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/2991)
- Added `options.credit` parameter to `MapboxImageryProvider`.
- Fixed an issue with drill picking at low frame rates that would cause a crash. [#3010](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/3010)
- Fixed a bug that prevented `setView` from working across all scene modes.
- Fixed a bug that caused `camera.positionWC` to occasionally return the incorrect value.
- Used all the template urls defined in the CesiumTerrain provider.[#3038](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/3038)

### 1.13 - 2015-09-01

- Breaking changes
  - Remove deprecated `AxisAlignedBoundingBox.intersect` and `BoundingSphere.intersect`. Use `BoundingSphere.intersectPlane` instead.
  - Remove deprecated `getFeatureInfoAsGeoJson` and `getFeatureInfoAsXml` constructor parameters from `WebMapServiceImageryProvider`.
- Added support for `GroundPrimitive` which works much like `Primitive` but drapes geometry over terrain. Valid geometries that can be draped on terrain are `CircleGeometry`, `CorridorGeometry`, `EllipseGeometry`, `PolygonGeometry`, and `RectangleGeometry`. Because of the cutting edge nature of this feature in WebGL, it requires the [EXT_frag_depth](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/EXT_frag_depth/) extension, which is currently only supported in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Apple support is expected in iOS 9 and MacOS Safari 9. Android support varies by hardware and IE11 will most likely never support it. You can use [webglreport.com](http://webglreport.com) to verify support for your hardware. Finally, this feature is currently only supported in Primitives and not yet available via the Entity API. [#2865](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/2865)
- Added `Scene.groundPrimitives`, which is a primitive collection like `Scene.primitives`, but for `GroundPrimitive` instances. It allows custom z-ordering. [#2960](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/2960) For example:

        // draws the ellipse on top of the rectangle
        var ellipse = scene.groundPrimitives.add(new Cesium.GroundPrimitive({...}));
        var rectangle = scene.groundPrimitives.add(new Cesium.GroundPrimitive({...}));

        // move the rectangle to draw on top of the ellipse
        scene.groundPrimitives.raise(rectangle);

- Added `reverseZ` tag to `UrlTemplateImageryProvider`. [#2961](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/2961)

### 1.10 - 2015-06-01

- Breaking changes
  - Existing bookmarks to documentation of static members have changed [#2757](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/2757).
  - Removed `InfoBoxViewModel.defaultSanitizer`, `InfoBoxViewModel.sanitizer`, and `Cesium.sanitize`, which was deprecated in 1.7.
  - Removed `InfoBoxViewModel.descriptionRawHtml`, which was deprecated in 1.7. Use `InfoBoxViewModel.description` instead.
  - Removed `GeoJsonDataSource.fromUrl`, which was deprecated in 1.7. Use `GeoJsonDataSource.load` instead. Unlike fromUrl, load can take either a url or parsed JSON object and returns a promise to a new instance, rather than a new instance.
  - Removed `GeoJsonDataSource.prototype.loadUrl`, which was deprecated in 1.7. Instead, pass a url as the first parameter to `GeoJsonDataSource.prototype.load`.
  - Removed `CzmlDataSource.prototype.loadUrl`, which was deprecated in 1.7. Instead, pass a url as the first parameter to `CzmlDataSource.prototype.load`.
  - Removed `CzmlDataSource.prototype.processUrl`, which was deprecated in 1.7. Instead, pass a url as the first parameter to `CzmlDataSource.prototype.process`.
  - Removed the `sourceUri` parameter to all `CzmlDataSource` load and process functions, which was deprecated in 1.7. Instead pass an `options` object with `sourceUri` property.
  - Removed `PolygonGraphics.positions` which was deprecated in 1.6. Instead, use `PolygonGraphics.hierarchy`.
  - Existing bookmarks to documentation of static members changed. [#2757](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/2757)
- Deprecated
  - `WebMapServiceImageryProvider` constructor parameters `options.getFeatureInfoAsGeoJson` and `options.getFeatureInfoAsXml` were deprecated and will be removed in Cesium 1.13. Use `options.getFeatureInfoFormats` instead.
  - Deprecated `Camera.clone`. It will be removed in 1.11.
  - Deprecated `Scene.fxaaOrderIndependentTranslucency`. It will be removed in 1.11. Use `Scene.fxaa` which is now `true` by default.
  - The Cesium sample models are now in the Binary glTF format (`.bgltf`). Cesium will also include the models as plain glTF (`.gltf`) until 1.13. Cesium support for `.gltf` will not be removed.
- Added `view` query parameter to the CesiumViewer app, which sets the initial camera position using longitude, latitude, height, heading, pitch and roll. For example: `http://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Build/Apps/CesiumViewer/index.html/index.html?view=-75.0,40.0,300.0,9.0,-13.0,3.0`
- Added `Billboard.heightReference` and `Label.heightReference` to clamp billboards and labels to terrain.
- Added support for the [CESIUM_binary_glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/new-extensions/extensions/CESIUM_binary_glTF/README.md) extension for loading binary blobs of glTF to `Model`. See [Faster 3D Models with Binary glTF](http://cesiumjs.org/2015/06/01/Binary-glTF/).
- Added support for the [CESIUM_RTC](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/new-extensions/extensions/CESIUM_RTC/README.md) glTF extension for high-precision rendering to `Model`.
- Added `PointPrimitive` and `PointPrimitiveCollection`, which are faster and use less memory than billboards with circles.
- Changed `Entity.point` to use the new `PointPrimitive` instead of billboards. This does not change the `Entity.point` API.
- Added `Scene.pickPosition` to reconstruct the WGS84 position from window coordinates.
- The default mouse controls now support panning and zooming on 3D models and other opaque geometry.
- Added `Camera.moveStart` and `Camera.moveEnd` events.
- Added `GeocoderViewModel.complete` event. Triggered after the camera flight is completed.
- `KmlDataSource` can now load a KML file that uses explicit XML namespacing, e.g. `kml:Document`.
- Setting `Entity.show` now properly toggles the display of all descendant entities, previously it only affected its direct children.
- Fixed a bug that sometimes caused `Entity` instances with `show` set to false to reappear when new `Entity` geometry is added. [#2686](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/2686)
- Added a `Rotation` object which, when passed to `SampledProperty`, always interpolates values towards the shortest angle. Also hooked up CZML to use `Rotation` for all time-dynamic rotations.
- Fixed a bug where moon rendered in front of foreground geometry. [#1964](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issue/1964)
- Fixed a bug where the sun was smeared when the skybox/stars was disabled. [#1829](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issue/1829)
- `TileProviderError` now optionally takes an `error` parameter with more details of the error or exception that occurred. `ImageryLayer` passes that information through when tiles fail to load. This allows tile provider error handling to take a different action when a tile returns a 404 versus a 500, for example.
- `ArcGisMapServerImageryProvider` now has a `maximumLevel` constructor parameter.
- `ArcGisMapServerImageryProvider` picking now works correctly when the `layers` parameter is specified. Previously, it would pick from all layers even if only displaying a subset.
- `WebMapServiceImageryProvider.pickFeatures` now works with WMS servers, such as Google Maps Engine, that can only return feature information in HTML format.
- `WebMapServiceImageryProvider` now accepts an array of `GetFeatureInfoFormat` instances that it will use to obtain information about the features at a given position on the globe. This enables an arbitrary `info_format` to be passed to the WMS server, and an arbitrary JavaScript function to be used to interpret the response.
- Fixed a crash caused by `ImageryLayer` attempting to generate mipmaps for textures that are not a power-of-two size.
- Fixed a bug where `ImageryLayerCollection.pickImageryLayerFeatures` would return incorrect results when picking from a terrain tile that was partially covered by correct-level imagery and partially covered by imagery from an ancestor level.
- Fixed incorrect counting of `debug.tilesWaitingForChildren` in `QuadtreePrimitive`.
- Added `throttleRequestsByServer.maximumRequestsPerServer` property.
- Changed `createGeometry` to load individual-geometry workers using a CommonJS-style `require` when run in a CommonJS-like environment.
- Added `buildModuleUrl.setBaseUrl` function to allow the Cesium base URL to be set without the use of the global CESIUM_BASE_URL variable.
- Changed `ThirdParty/zip` to defer its call to `buildModuleUrl` until it is needed, rather than executing during module loading.
- Added optional drilling limit to `Scene.drillPick`.
- Added optional `ellipsoid` parameter to construction options of imagery and terrain providers that were lacking it. Note that terrain bounding spheres are precomputed on the server, so any supplied terrain ellipsoid must match the one used by the server.
- Added debug option to `Scene` to show the depth buffer information for a specified view frustum slice and exposed capability in `CesiumInspector` widget.
- Added new leap second for 30 June 2015 at UTC 23:59:60.
- Upgraded Autolinker from version 0.15.2 to 0.17.1.

  - The `Entity` constructor taking a single string value for the id has been deprecated. The constructor now takes an options object which allows you to provide any and all `Entity` related properties at construction time. Support for the deprecated behavior will be removed in Cesium 1.9.
  - The `EntityCollection.entities` and `CompositeEntityCollect.entities` properties have both been renamed to `values`. Support for the deprecated behavior will be removed in Cesium 1.9.
- Fixed an issue which caused order independent translucency to be broken on many video cards. Disabling order independent translucency should no longer be necessary.
- `GeoJsonDataSource` now supports polygons with holes.
- Many Sandcastle examples have been rewritten to make use of the newly improved Entity API.
- Instead of throwing an exception when there are not enough unique positions to define a geometry, creating a `Primitive` will succeed, but not render. [#2375](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/2375)
- Improved performance of asynchronous geometry creation (as much as 20% faster in some use cases). [#2342](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/2342)
- Fixed picking in 2D. [#2447](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/2447)
- Added `viewer.entities` which allows you to easily create and manage `Entity` instances without a corresponding `DataSource`. This is just a shortcut to `viewer.dataSourceDisplay.defaultDataSource.entities`
- Added `viewer.zoomTo` and `viewer.flyTo` which takes an entity, array of entities, `EntityCollection`, or `DataSource` as a parameter and zooms or flies to the corresponding visualization.
- Setting `viewer.trackedEntity` to `undefined` will now restore the camera controls to their default states.
- When you track an entity by clicking on the track button in the `InfoBox`, you can now stop tracking by clicking the button a second time.
- Added `Quaternion.fromHeadingPitchRoll` to create a rotation from heading, pitch, and roll angles.
- Added `Transforms.headingPitchRollToFixedFrame` to create a local frame from a position and heading/pitch/roll angles.
- Added `Transforms.headingPitchRollQuaternion` which is the quaternion rotation from `Transforms.headingPitchRollToFixedFrame`.
- Added `Color.fromAlpha` and `Color.withAlpha` to make it easy to create translucent colors from constants, i.e. `var translucentRed = Color.RED.withAlpha(0.95)`.
- Added `PolylineVolumeGraphics` and `Entity.polylineVolume`
- Added `Camera.lookAtTransform` which sets the camera position and orientation given a transformation matrix defining a reference frame and either a cartesian offset or heading/pitch/range from the center of that frame.
- Added `Camera.setView` (which use heading, pitch, and roll) and `Camera.roll`.
- Added an orientation option to `Camera.flyTo` that can be either direction and up unit vectors or heading, pitch and roll angles.
- Added `BillboardGraphics.imageSubRegion`, to enable custom texture atlas use for `Entity` instances.
- Added `CheckerboardMaterialProperty` to enable use of the checkerboard material with the entity API.
- Added `PolygonHierarchy` to make defining polygons with holes clearer.
- Added `PolygonGraphics.hierarchy` for supporting polygons with holes via data sources.
- Added `BoundingSphere.fromBoundingSpheres`, which creates a `BoundingSphere` that encloses the specified array of BoundingSpheres.
- Added `Model.readyPromise` and `Primitive.readyPromise` which are promises that resolve when the primitives are ready.
- `ConstantProperty` can now hold any value; previously it was limited to values that implemented `equals` and `clones` functions, as well as a few special cases.
- Fixed a bug in `EllipsoidGeodesic` that caused it to modify the `height` of the positions passed to the constructor or to to `setEndPoints`.
- `WebMapTileServiceImageryProvider` now supports RESTful requests (by accepting a tile-URL template).
- Fixed a bug that caused `Camera.roll` to be around 180 degrees, indicating the camera was upside-down, when in the Southern hemisphere.
- The object returned by `Primitive.getGeometryInstanceAttributes` now contains the instance's bounding sphere and repeated calls will always now return the same object instance.
- Fixed a bug that caused dynamic geometry outlines widths to not work on implementations that support them.
- The `SelectionIndicator` widget now works for all entity visualization and uses the center of visualization instead of entity.position. This produces more accurate results, especially for shapes, volumes, and models.
- Added `CustomDataSource` which makes it easy to create and manage a group of entities without having to manually implement the DataSource interface in a new class.
- Added `DataSourceDisplay.defaultDataSource` which is an instance of `CustomDataSource` and allows you to easily add custom entities to the display.
- Added `Camera.viewBoundingSphere` and `Camera.flyToBoundingSphere`, which as the names imply, sets or flies to a view that encloses the provided `BoundingSphere`
- For constant `Property` values, there is no longer a need to create an instance of `ConstantProperty` or `ConstantPositionProperty`, you can now assign a value directly to the corresponding property. The same is true for material images and colors.
- All Entity and related classes can now be assigned using anonymous objects as well as be passed template objects. The correct underlying instance is created for you automatically. For a more detailed overview of changes to the Entity API, see [this forum thread](https://community.cesium.com/t/cesium-in-2015-entity-api/1863) for details.

- Fixed a bug in `Model` where the wrong animations could be used when the model was created from glTF JSON instead of a url to a glTF file. [#2078](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/2078)
- Fixed a bug in `GeoJsonDataSource` which was causing polygons with height values to be drawn onto the surface.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when quickly adding and removing imagery layers.
- Eliminated imagery artifacts at some zoom levels due to Mercator reprojection.

- Cesium now ships with a default web.config file to simplify IIS deployment.

### 1.1 - 2014-09-02

- Added a new imagery provider, `WebMapTileServiceImageryProvider`, for accessing tiles on a WMTS 1.0.0 server.
- Added an optional `pickFeatures` function to the `ImageryProvider` interface. With supporting imagery providers, such as `WebMapServiceImageryProvider`, it can be used to determine the rasterized features under a particular location.
- Added `ImageryLayerCollection.pickImageryLayerFeatures`. It determines the rasterized imagery layer features intersected by a given pick ray by querying supporting layers using `ImageryProvider.pickFeatures`.
- Added `tileWidth`, `tileHeight`, `minimumLevel`, and `tilingScheme` parameters to the `WebMapServiceImageryProvider` constructor.
- Added `id` property to `Scene` which is a readonly unique identifier associated with each instance.
- Added `FeatureDetection.supportsWebWorkers`.
- Greatly improved the performance of time-varying polylines when using DataSources.
- `viewerEntityMixin` now automatically queries for imagery layer features on click and shows their properties in the `InfoBox` panel.
- Fixed a bug in terrain and imagery loading that could cause an inconsistent frame rate when moving around the globe, especially on a faster internet connection.
- Fixed a bug that caused `SceneTransforms.wgs84ToWindowCoordinates` to incorrectly return `undefined` when in 2D.
- Fixed a bug in `ImageryLayer` that caused layer images to be rendered twice for each terrain tile that existed prior to adding the imagery layer.
- Fixed a bug in `Camera.pickEllipsoid` that caused it to return the back side of the ellipsoid when near the surface.
- Fixed a bug which prevented `loadWithXhr` from working with older browsers, such as Internet Explorer 9.

### 1.0 - 2014-08-01

- Breaking changes ([why so many?](https://community.cesium.com/t/moving-towards-cesium-1-0/1209))

  - All `Matrix2`, `Matrix3`, `Matrix4` and `Quaternion` functions that take a `result` parameter now require the parameter, except functions starting with `from`.
  - Removed `Billboard.imageIndex` and `BillboardCollection.textureAtlas`. Instead, use `Billboard.image`.

    - Code that looked like:

            var billboards = new Cesium.BillboardCollection();
            var textureAtlas = new Cesium.TextureAtlas({
                scene : scene,
                images : images // array of loaded images
            });
            billboards.textureAtlas = textureAtlas;
            billboards.add({
                imageIndex : 0,
                position : //...
            });

    - should now look like:

            var billboards = new Cesium.BillboardCollection();
            billboards.add({
                image : '../images/Cesium_Logo_overlay.png',
                position : //...
            });

  - Updated the [Model Converter](http://cesiumjs.org/convertmodel.html) and `Model` to support [glTF 0.8](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/schema-8/specification/README.md). See the [forum post](https://community.cesium.com/t/cesium-and-gltf-version-compatibility/1343) for full details.
  - `Model` primitives are now rotated to be `Z`-up to match Cesium convention; glTF stores models with `Y` up.
  - `SimplePolylineGeometry` and `PolylineGeometry` now curve to follow the ellipsoid surface by default. To disable this behavior, set the option `followSurface` to `false`.
  - Renamed `DynamicScene` layer to `DataSources`. The following types were also renamed:
    - `DynamicBillboard` -> `BillboardGraphics`
    - `DynamicBillboardVisualizer` -> `BillboardVisualizer`

  - Renamed `DataSource.dynamicObjects` to `DataSource.entities`.
  - `EntityCollection.getObjects()` and `CompositeEntityCollection.getObjects()` are now properties named `EntityCollection.entities` and `CompositeEntityCollection.entities`.
  - Renamed `Viewer.trackedObject` and `Viewer.selectedObject` to `Viewer.trackedEntity` and `Viewer.selectedEntity` when using the `viewerEntityMixin`.
  - Renamed functions for consistency:
    - `BoundingSphere.getPlaneDistances` -> `BoundingSphere.computePlaneDistances`
    - `Cartesian[2,3,4].getMaximumComponent` -> `Cartesian[2,3,4].maximumComponent`
    - `Cartesian[2,3,4].getMinimumComponent` -> `Cartesian[2,3,4].minimumComponent`
    - `Cartesian[2,3,4].getMaximumByComponent` -> `Cartesian[2,3,4].maximumByComponent`

    - `Matrix3.getEigenDecompostion` -> `Matrix3.computeEigenDecomposition`
    - `Occluder.getVisibility` -> `Occluder.computeVisibility`
    - `Occluder.getOccludeePoint` -> `Occluder.computerOccludeePoint`
    - `QuadraticRealPolynomial.discriminant` -> `QuadraticRealPolynomial.computeDiscriminant`
    - `QuadraticRealPolynomial.realRoots` -> `QuadraticRealPolynomial.computeRealRoots`
    - `QuarticRealPolynomial.discriminant` -> `QuarticRealPolynomial.computeDiscriminant`

    - `Rectangle.getNortheast` -> `Rectangle.northeast`
    - `Rectangle.getCenter` -> `Rectangle.center`
    - `CullingVolume.getVisibility` -> `CullingVolume.computeVisibility`
  - Replaced `PerspectiveFrustum.fovy` with `PerspectiveFrustum.fov` which will change the field of view angle in either the `X` or `Y` direction depending on the aspect ratio.
  - Removed the following from the Cesium API: `Transforms.earthOrientationParameters`, `EarthOrientationParameters`, `EarthOrientationParametersSample`, `Transforms.iau2006XysData`, `Iau2006XysData`, `Iau2006XysSample`, `IauOrientationAxes`, `TimeConstants`, `Scene.frameState`, `FrameState`, `EncodedCartesian3`, `EllipsoidalOccluder`, `TextureAtlas`, and `FAR`. These are still available but are not part of the official API and may change in future versions.
  - Removed `DynamicObject.vertexPositions`. Use `DynamicWall.positions`, `DynamicPolygon.positions`, and `DynamicPolyline.positions` instead.
  - Removed `defaultPoint`, `defaultLine`, and `defaultPolygon` from `GeoJsonDataSource`.
  - Removed `Primitive.allow3DOnly`. Set the `Scene` constructor option `scene3DOnly` instead.
  - `SampledProperty` and `SampledPositionProperty` no longer extrapolate outside of their sample data time range by default.
  - Changed the following functions to properties:
    - `TerrainProvider.hasWaterMask`
    - `CesiumTerrainProvider.hasWaterMask`
    - `ArcGisImageServerTerrainProvider.hasWaterMask`
    - `EllipsoidTerrainProvider.hasWaterMask`
    - `VRTheWorldTerrainProvider.hasWaterMask`
  - Removed `ScreenSpaceCameraController.ellipsoid`. The behavior that depended on the ellipsoid is now determined based on the scene state.
  - Sandcastle examples now automatically wrap the example code in RequireJS boilerplate. To upgrade any custom examples, copy the code into an existing example (such as Hello World) and save a new file.
  - Removed `CustomSensorVolume`, `RectangularPyramidSensorVolume`, `DynamicCone`, `DynamicConeVisualizerUsingCustomSensor`, `DynamicPyramid` and `DynamicPyramidVisualizer`. This will be moved to a plugin in early August. [#1887](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/1887)
  - If `Primitive.modelMatrix` is changed after creation, it only affects primitives with one instance and only in 3D mode.
  - `ImageryLayer` properties `alpha`, `brightness`, `contrast`, `hue`, `saturation`, and `gamma` may no longer be functions. If you need to change these values each frame, consider moving your logic to an event handler for `Scene.preRender`.
  - Removed `closeTop` and `closeBottom` options from `RectangleGeometry`.
  - CZML changes:
    - CZML is now versioned using the <major>.<minor> scheme. For example, any CZML 1.0 implementation will be able to load any 1.<minor> document (with graceful degradation). Major version number increases will be reserved for breaking changes. We fully expect these major version increases to happen, as CZML is still in development, but we wanted to give developers a stable target to work with.
    - A `"1.0"` version string is required to be on the document packet, which is required to be the first packet in a CZML file. Previously the `document` packet was optional; it is now mandatory. The simplest document packet is:
      ```
      {
        "id":"document",
        "version":"1.0"
      }
      ```
    - The `vertexPositions` property has been removed. There is now a `positions` property directly on objects that use it, currently `polyline`, `polygon`, and `wall`.
    - `cone`, `pyramid`, and `vector` have been removed from the core CZML schema. They are now treated as extensions maintained by Analytical Graphics and have been renamed to `agi_conicSensor`, `agi_customPatternSensor`, and `agi_vector` respectively.
    - The `orientation` property has been changed to match Cesium convention. To update existing CZML documents, conjugate the quaternion values.
    - `pixelOffset` now uses the top-left of the screen as the origin; previously it was the bottom-left. To update existing documents, negate the `y` value.
    - Removed `color`, `outlineColor`, and `outlineWidth` properties from `polyline` and `path`. There is a new `material` property that allows you to specify a variety of materials, such as `solidColor`, `polylineOutline` and `polylineGlow`.
    - See the [CZML Schema](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/wiki/CZML-Content) for more details. We plan on greatly improving this document in the coming weeks.

- Added camera collision detection with terrain to the default mouse interaction.
- Modified the default camera tilt mouse behavior to tilt about the point clicked, taking into account terrain.
- Modified the default camera mouse behavior to look about the camera's position when the sky is clicked.
- Cesium can now render an unlimited number of imagery layers, no matter how few texture units are supported by the hardware.
- Added support for rendering terrain lighting with oct-encoded per-vertex normals. Added `CesiumTerrainProvider.requestVertexNormals` to request per vertex normals. Added `hasVertexNormals` property to all terrain providers to indicate whether or not vertex normals are included in the requested terrain tiles.
- Added `Globe.getHeight` and `Globe.pick` for finding the terrain height at a given Cartographic coordinate and picking the terrain with a ray.
- Added `scene3DOnly` options to `Viewer`, `CesiumWidget`, and `Scene` constructors. This setting optimizes memory usage and performance for 3D mode at the cost of losing the ability to use 2D or Columbus View.
- Added `forwardExtrapolationType`, `forwardExtrapolationDuration`, `backwardExtrapolationType`, and `backwardExtrapolationDuration` to `SampledProperty` and `SampledPositionProperty` which allows the user to specify how a property calculates its value when outside the range of its sample data.
- Prevent primitives from flashing off and on when modifying static DataSources.
- Added the following methods to `IntersectionTests`: `rayTriangle`, `lineSegmentTriangle`, `raySphere`, and `lineSegmentSphere`.
- Matrix types now have `add` and `subtract` functions.
- `Matrix3` type now has a `fromCrossProduct` function.
- Added `CesiumMath.signNotZero`, `CesiumMath.toSNorm` and `CesiumMath.fromSNorm` functions.
- DataSource & CZML models now default to North-East-Down orientation if none is provided.
- `TileMapServiceImageryProvider` now works with tilesets created by tools that better conform to the TMS specification. In particular, a profile of `global-geodetic` or `global-mercator` is now supported (in addition to the previous `geodetic` and `mercator`) and in these profiles it is assumed that the X coordinates of the bounding box correspond to the longitude direction.
- `EntityCollection` and `CompositeEntityCollection` now include the array of modified entities as the last parameter to their `onCollectionChanged` event.
- `RectangleGeometry`, `RectangleOutlineGeometry` and `RectanglePrimitive` can cross the international date line.

## Beta Releases

### b30 - 2014-07-01

- Breaking changes ([why so many?](https://community.cesium.com/t/moving-towards-cesium-1-0/1209))

  - CZML property references now use a `#` symbol to separate identifier from property path. `objectId.position` should now be `objectId#position`.
  - All `Cartesian2`, `Cartesian3`, `Cartesian4`, `TimeInterval`, and `JulianDate` functions that take a `result` parameter now require the parameter (except for functions starting with `from`).
  - Modified `Transforms.pointToWindowCoordinates` and `SceneTransforms.wgs84ToWindowCoordinates` to return window coordinates with origin at the top left corner.
  - `Billboard.pixelOffset` and `Label.pixelOffset` now have their origin at the top left corner.
  - Replaced `CameraFlightPath.createAnimation` with `Camera.flyTo` and replaced `CameraFlightPath.createAnimationRectangle` with `Camera.flyToRectangle`. Code that looked like:

            scene.animations.add(Cesium.CameraFlightPath.createAnimation(scene, {
                destination : Cesium.Cartesian3.fromDegrees(-117.16, 32.71, 15000.0)
            }));

    should now look like:

            scene.camera.flyTo({
                destination : Cesium.Cartesian3.fromDegrees(-117.16, 32.71, 15000.0)
            });

  - In `Camera.flyTo` and `Camera.flyToRectangle`:
    - `options.duration` is now in seconds, not milliseconds.
    - Renamed `options.endReferenceFrame` to `options.endTransform`.
    - Renamed `options.onComplete` to `options.complete`.
    - Renamed `options.onCancel` to `options.cancel`.
  - The following are now in seconds, not milliseconds.
    - `Scene.morphToColumbusView`, `Scene.morphTo2D`, and `Scene.morphTo3D` parameter `duration`.
    - `HomeButton` constructor parameter `options.duration`, `HomeButtonViewModel` constructor parameter `duration`, and `HomeButtonViewModel.duration`.
    - `SceneModePicker` constructor parameter `duration`, `SceneModePickerViewModel` constructor parameter `duration`, and `SceneModePickerViewModel.duration`.

    - The default constructor no longer creates a date at the current time, use `JulianDate.now()` instead.
    - Removed `JulianDate.getJulianTimeFraction` and `JulianDate.compareTo`
    - `new JulianDate()` -> `JulianDate.now()`
    - `date.getJulianDayNumber()` -> `date.dayNumber`
    - `date.getSecondsOfDay()` -> `secondsOfDay`
    - `date.getTotalDays()` -> `JulianDate.getTotalDays(date)`
    - `date.getSecondsDifference(arg1, arg2)` -> `JulianDate.getSecondsDifference(arg2, arg1)` (Note, order of arguments flipped)
    - `date.getDaysDifference(arg1, arg2)` -> `JulianDate.getDaysDifference(arg2, arg1)` (Note, order of arguments flipped)
    - `date.getTaiMinusUtc()` -> `JulianDate.getTaiMinusUtc(date)`
    - `date.addSeconds(seconds)` -> `JulianDate.addSeconds(date, seconds)`
    - `date.addMinutes(minutes)` -> `JulianDate.addMinutes(date, minutes)`
    - `date.addHours(hours)` -> `JulianDate.addHours(date, hours)`
    - `date.addDays(days)` -> `JulianDate.addDays(date, days)`
    - `date.lessThan(right)` -> `JulianDate.lessThan(left, right)`
    - `date.lessThanOrEquals(right)` -> `JulianDate.lessThanOrEquals(left, right)`
    - `date.greaterThan(right)` -> `JulianDate.greaterThan(left, right)`
    - `date.greaterThanOrEquals(right)` -> `JulianDate.greaterThanOrEquals(left, right)`
  - Refactored `TimeInterval` to be in line with other Core types.

    - The constructor no longer requires parameters and now takes a single options parameter. Code that looked like:

            new TimeInterval(startTime, stopTime, true, true, data);

    should now look like:

            new TimeInterval({
                start : startTime,
                stop : stopTime,
                isStartIncluded : true,
                isStopIncluded : true,
                data : data
            });

    - `TimeInterval.fromIso8601` now takes a single options parameter. Code that looked like:

                isStopIncluded : true,
                data : data
            });

    - `interval.intersect(otherInterval)` -> `TimeInterval.intersect(interval, otherInterval)`
    - `interval.contains(date)` -> `TimeInterval.contains(interval, date)`

  - Removed `TimeIntervalCollection.intersectInterval`.
  - `TimeIntervalCollection.findInterval` now takes a single options parameter instead of individual parameters. Code that looked like:

            intervalCollection.findInterval(startTime, stopTime, false, true);

    should now look like:

            intervalCollection.findInterval({
                start : startTime,
                stop : stopTime,
                isStartIncluded : false,
                isStopIncluded : true
            });

  - `TimeIntervalCollection.empty` was renamed to `TimeIntervalCollection.isEmpty`

  - `CesiumWidget.showErrorPanel` now takes a `message` parameter in between the previous `title` and `error` parameters.
  - Removed `Camera.createCorrectPositionAnimation`.
  - Moved `LeapSecond.leapSeconds` to `JulianDate.leapSeconds`.
  - `Event.removeEventListener` no longer throws `DeveloperError` if the `listener` does not exist; it now returns `false`.
  - Enumeration values of `SceneMode` have better correspondence with mode names to help with debugging.
  - The build process now requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to be installed on the system.

- Cesium now supports Internet Explorer 11.0.9 on desktops. For the best results, use the new [IE Developer Channel](http://devchannel.modern.ie/) for development.
- `ReferenceProperty` can now handle sub-properties, for example, `myObject#billboard.scale`.
- `DynamicObject.id` can now include period characters.
- Added `PolylineGlowMaterialProperty` which enables data sources to use the PolylineGlow material.
- Fixed support for embedded resources in glTF models.
- Added `HermitePolynomialApproximation.interpolate` for performing interpolation when derivative information is available.
- `SampledProperty` and `SampledPositionProperty` can now store derivative information for each sample value. This allows for more accurate interpolation when using `HermitePolynomialApproximation`.

- Added `PerformanceWatchdog` widget and `viewerPerformanceWatchdogMixin`.
- `Viewer` and `CesiumWidget` now provide more user-friendly error messages when an initialization or rendering error occurs.
- `Viewer` and `CesiumWidget` now take a new optional parameter, `creditContainer`.
- `Viewer` can now optionally be constructed with a `DataSourceCollection`. Previously, it always created one itself internally.
- Fixed a problem that could rarely lead to the camera's `tilt` property being `NaN`.

- Added `TimeIntervalCollection.isStartIncluded` and `TimeIntervalCollection.isStopIncluded`.
- Added `Cesium.VERSION` to the combined `Cesium.js` file.
- Made general improvements to the [reference documentation](http://cesiumjs.org/refdoc.html).
- Updated third-party [Tween.js](https://github.com/sole/tween.js/) from r7 to r13.
- Updated third-party JSDoc 3.3.0-alpha5 to 3.3.0-alpha9.
- The development web server has been rewritten in Node.js, and is now included as part of each release.

      - `getTextureAtlas`, `setTextureAtlas` -> `textureAtlas`
      - `getDestroyTextureAtlas`, `setDestroyTextureAtlas` -> `destroyTextureAtlas`
  - Removed `Scene.getUniformState()`. Use `scene.context.getUniformState()`.
  - Visualizers no longer create a `dynamicObject` property on the primitives they create. Instead, they set the `id` property that is standard for all primitives.
  - The `propertyChanged` on DynamicScene objects has been renamed to `definitionChanged`. Also, the event is now raised in the case of an existing property being modified as well as having a new property assigned (previously only property assignment would raise the event).
  - The `visualizerTypes` parameter to the `DataSouceDisplay` has been changed to a callback function that creates an array of visualizer instances.
  - `DynamicDirectionsProperty` and `DynamicVertexPositionsProperty` were both removed, they have been superseded by `PropertyArray` and `PropertyPositionArray`, which make it easy for DataSource implementations to create time-dynamic arrays.
  - `VisualizerCollection` has been removed. It is superseded by `DataSourceDisplay`.
  - `DynamicEllipsoidVisualizer`, `DynamicPolygonVisualizer`, and `DynamicPolylineVisualizer` have been removed. They are superseded by `GeometryVisualizer` and corresponding `GeometryUpdater` implementations; `EllipsoidGeometryUpdater`, `PolygonGeometryUpdater`, `PolylineGeometryUpdater`.
  - Modified `CameraFlightPath` functions to take place in the camera's current reference frame. The arguments to the function now need to be given in world coordinates and an optional reference frame can be given when the flight is completed.
  - `PixelDatatype` properties are now JavaScript numbers, not `Enumeration` instances.
  - `combine` now takes two objects instead of an array, and defaults to copying shallow references. The `allowDuplicates` parameter has been removed. In the event of duplicate properties, the first object's properties will be used.
  - Removed `FeatureDetection.supportsCrossOriginImagery`. This check was only useful for very old versions of WebKit.
- Added `Model` for drawing 3D models using glTF. See the [tutorial](http://cesiumjs.org/2014/03/03/Cesium-3D-Models-Tutorial/) and [Sandcastle example](http://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Apps/Sandcastle/index.html?src=3D%20Models.html&label=Showcases).
- DynamicScene now makes use of [Geometry and Appearances](http://cesiumjs.org/2013/11/04/Geometry-and-Appearances/), which provides a tremendous improvements to DataSource visualization (CZML, GeoJSON, etc..). Extruded geometries are now supported and in many use cases performance is an order of magnitude faster.
- Added new `SelectionIndicator` and `InfoBox` widgets to `Viewer`, activated by `viewerDynamicObjectMixin`.
- `CesiumTerrainProvider` now supports mesh-based terrain like the tiles created by [STK Terrain Server](https://community.cesium.com/t/stk-terrain-server-beta/1017).
- Fixed rendering artifact on translucent objects when zooming in or out.
- Added `CesiumInspector` widget for graphics debugging. In Cesium Viewer, it is enabled by using the query parameter `inspector=true`. Also see the [Sandcastle example](http://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Apps/Sandcastle/index.html?src=Cesium%20Inspector.html&label=Showcases).
- Improved compatibility with Internet Explorer 11.
- `DynamicEllipse`, `DynamicPolygon`, and `DynamicEllipsoid` now have properties matching their geometry counterpart, i.e. `EllipseGeometry`, `EllipseOutlineGeometry`, etc. These properties are also available in CZML.
- Added a `definitionChanged` event to the `Property` interface as well as most `DynamicScene` objects. This makes it easy for a client to observe when new data is loaded into a property or object.
- Added an `isConstant` property to the `Property` interface. Constant properties do not change in regards to simulation time, i.e. `Property.getValue` will always return the same result for all times.
- `ConstantProperty` is now mutable; it's value can be updated via `ConstantProperty.setValue`.
- Improved the quality of imagery near the poles when the imagery source uses a `GeographicTilingScheme`.
- `OpenStreetMapImageryProvider` now supports imagery with a minimum level.
- `BingMapsImageryProvider` now uses HTTPS by default for metadata and tiles when the document is loaded over HTTPS.
- Added the ability for imagery providers to specify view-dependent attribution to be display in the `CreditDisplay`.
- View-dependent imagery source attribution is now added to the `CreditDisplay` by the `BingMapsImageryProvider`.
- Fixed viewing an extent. [#1431](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/1431)
- Fixed camera tilt in ICRF. [#544](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/544)
- Fixed developer error when zooming in 2D. If the zoom would create an invalid frustum, nothing is done. [#1432](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/1432)
- Fixed `WallGeometry` bug that failed by removing positions that were less close together by less than 6 decimal places. [#1483](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/1483)
- Fixed `EllipsoidGeometry` texture coordinates. [#1454](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/1454)
- Added a loop property to `Polyline`s to join the first and last point. [#960](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/960)
- Use `performance.now()` instead of `Date.now()`, when available, to limit time spent loading terrain and imagery tiles. This results in more consistent frame rates while loading tiles on some systems.
- `RequestErrorEvent` now includes the headers that were returned with the error response.
- Added `AssociativeArray`, which is a helper class for maintaining a hash of objects that also needs to be iterated often.
- Added `TimeIntervalCollection.getChangedEvent` which returns an event that will be raised whenever intervals are updated.
- Added a second parameter to `Material.fromType` to override default uniforms. [#1522](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/1522)
- Added `Intersections2D` class containing operations on 2D triangles.
- Added `czm_inverseViewProjection` and `czm_inverseModelViewProjection` automatic GLSL uniform.

### b25 - 2014-02-03

- Breaking changes:
  - The `Viewer` constructor argument `options.fullscreenElement` now matches the `FullscreenButton` default of `document.body`, it was previously the `Viewer` container itself.
  - Removed `Viewer.objectTracked` event; `Viewer.trackedObject` is now an ES5 Knockout observable that can be subscribed to directly.
  - Replaced `PerformanceDisplay` with `Scene.debugShowFramesPerSecond`.
  - `Asphalt`, `Blob`, `Brick`, `Cement`, `Erosion`, `Facet`, `Grass`, `TieDye`, and `Wood` materials were moved to the [Materials Pack Plugin](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-materials-pack).
  - Renamed `GeometryPipeline.createAttributeIndices` to `GeometryPipeline.createAttributeLocations`.
  - Renamed `attributeIndices` property to `attributeLocations` when calling `Context.createVertexArrayFromGeometry`.
  - `PerformanceDisplay` requires a DOM element as a parameter.
- Fixed globe rendering in the current Canary version of Google Chrome.
- `Viewer` now monitors the clock settings of the first added `DataSource` for changes, and also now has a constructor option `automaticallyTrackFirstDataSourceClock` which will turn off this behavior.
- The `DynamicObjectCollection` created by `CzmlDataSource` now sends a single `collectionChanged` event after CZML is loaded; previously it was sending an event every time an object was created or removed during the load process.
- Added `ScreenSpaceCameraController.enableInputs` to fix issue with inputs not being restored after overlapping camera flights.
- Fixed picking in 2D with rotated map. [#1337](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/1337)
- `TileMapServiceImageryProvider` can now handle casing differences in tilemapresource.xml.
- `OpenStreetMapImageryProvider` now supports imagery with a minimum level.
- Added `Quaternion.fastSlerp` and `Quaternion.fastSquad`.
- Upgraded Tween.js to version r12.

### b24 - 2014-01-06

- Breaking changes:

  - Added `allowTextureFilterAnisotropic` (default: `true`) and `failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat` (default: `true`) properties to the `contextOptions` property passed to `Viewer`, `CesiumWidget`, and `Scene` constructors and moved the existing properties to a new `webgl` sub-property. For example, code that looked like:

           var viewer = new Viewer('cesiumContainer', {
               contextOptions : {
                 alpha : true
               }
           });

    should now look like:

           var viewer = new Viewer('cesiumContainer', {
               contextOptions : {
                 webgl : {
                   alpha : true
                 }
               }
           });

  - The read-only `Cartesian3` objects must now be cloned to camera properties instead of assigned. For example, code that looked like:

          camera.up = Cartesian3.UNIT_Z;

    should now look like:

          Cartesian3.clone(Cartesian3.UNIT_Z, camera.up);

  - The CSS files for individual widgets, e.g. `BaseLayerPicker.css`, no longer import other CSS files. Most applications should import `widgets.css` (and optionally `lighter.css`).
  - `SvgPath` has been replaced by a Knockout binding: `cesiumSvgPath`.
  - `DynamicObject.availability` is now a `TimeIntervalCollection` instead of a `TimeInterval`.
  - Removed prototype version of `BoundingSphere.transform`.
  - `Matrix4.multiplyByPoint` now returns a `Cartesian3` instead of a `Cartesian4`.

- The minified, combined `Cesium.js` file now omits certain `DeveloperError` checks, to increase performance and reduce file size. When developing your application, we recommend using the unminified version locally for early error detection, then deploying the minified version to production.
- Fixed disabling `CentralBody.enableLighting`.
- Fixed `Geocoder` flights when following an object.
- The `Viewer` widget now clears `Geocoder` input when the user clicks the home button.
- The `Geocoder` input type has been changed to `search`, which improves usability (particularly on mobile devices). There were also some other minor styling improvements.
- Added `CentralBody.maximumScreenSpaceError`.
- Added `translateEventTypes`, `zoomEventTypes`, `rotateEventTypes`, `tiltEventTypes`, and `lookEventTypes` properties to `ScreenSpaceCameraController` to change the default mouse inputs.
- Added `Billboard.setPixelOffsetScaleByDistance`, `Label.setPixelOffsetScaleByDistance`, `DynamicBillboard.pixelOffsetScaleByDistance`, and `DynamicLabel.pixelOffsetScaleByDistance` to control minimum/maximum pixelOffset scaling based on camera distance.
- Added `BoundingSphere.transformsWithoutScale`.
- Added `fromArray` function to `Matrix2`, `Matrix3` and `Matrix4`.
- Added `Matrix4.multiplyTransformation`, `Matrix4.multiplyByPointAsVector`.

### b23 - 2013-12-02

- Breaking changes:

  - Changed the `CatmulRomSpline` and `HermiteSpline` constructors from taking an array of structures to a structure of arrays. For example, code that looked like:

           var controlPoints = [
               { point: new Cartesian3(1235398.0, -4810983.0, 4146266.0), time: 0.0},
               { point: new Cartesian3(1372574.0, -5345182.0, 4606657.0), time: 1.5},
               { point: new Cartesian3(-757983.0, -5542796.0, 4514323.0), time: 3.0},
               { point: new Cartesian3(-2821260.0, -5248423.0, 4021290.0), time: 4.5},
               { point: new Cartesian3(-2539788.0, -4724797.0, 3620093.0), time: 6.0}
           ];
           var spline = new HermiteSpline(controlPoints);

    should now look like:

           var spline = new HermiteSpline({
               times : [ 0.0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0 ],
               points : [
                   new Cartesian3(1235398.0, -4810983.0, 4146266.0),
                   new Cartesian3(1372574.0, -5345182.0, 4606657.0),
                   new Cartesian3(-757983.0, -5542796.0, 4514323.0),
                   new Cartesian3(-2821260.0, -5248423.0, 4021290.0),
                   new Cartesian3(-2539788.0, -4724797.0, 3620093.0)
               ]
           });

  - `loadWithXhr` now takes an options object, and allows specifying HTTP method and data to send with the request.
  - Renamed `SceneTransitioner.onTransitionStart` to `SceneTransitioner.transitionStart`.
  - Renamed `SceneTransitioner.onTransitionComplete` to `SceneTransitioner.transitionComplete`.
  - Renamed `CesiumWidget.onRenderLoopError` to `CesiumWidget.renderLoopError`.
  - Renamed `SceneModePickerViewModel.onTransitionStart` to `SceneModePickerViewModel.transitionStart`.
  - Renamed `Viewer.onRenderLoopError` to `Viewer.renderLoopError`.
  - Renamed `Viewer.onDropError` to `Viewer.dropError`.
  - Renamed `CesiumViewer.onDropError` to `CesiumViewer.dropError`.
  - Renamed `viewerDragDropMixin.onDropError` to `viewerDragDropMixin.dropError`.
  - Renamed `viewerDynamicObjectMixin.onObjectTracked` to `viewerDynamicObjectMixin.objectTracked`.
  - `PixelFormat`, `PrimitiveType`, `IndexDatatype`, `TextureWrap`, `TextureMinificationFilter`, and `TextureMagnificationFilter` properties are now JavaScript numbers, not `Enumeration` instances.
  - Replaced `sizeInBytes` properties on `IndexDatatype` with `IndexDatatype.getSizeInBytes`.

- Added `QuaternionSpline` and `LinearSpline`.
- Added `Quaternion.log`, `Quaternion.exp`, `Quaternion.innerQuadrangle`, and `Quaternion.squad`.
- Added `Matrix3.inverse` and `Matrix3.determinant`.
- Added `ObjectOrientedBoundingBox`.
- Added `Ellipsoid.transformPositionFromScaledSpace`.
- Added `Math.nextPowerOfTwo`.

### b22 - 2013-11-01

- Breaking changes:
  - Reversed the rotation direction of `Matrix3.fromQuaternion` to be consistent with graphics conventions. Mirrored change in `Quaternion.fromRotationMatrix`.
  - The following prototype functions were removed:
    - From `Matrix2`, `Matrix3`, and `Matrix4`: `toArray`, `getColumn`, `setColumn`, `getRow`, `setRow`, `multiply`, `multiplyByVector`, `multiplyByScalar`, `negate`, and `transpose`.
    - From `Matrix4`: `getTranslation`, `getRotation`, `inverse`, `inverseTransformation`, `multiplyByTranslation`, `multiplyByUniformScale`, `multiplyByPoint`. For example, code that previously looked like `matrix.toArray();` should now look like `Matrix3.toArray(matrix);`.
  - Replaced `DynamicPolyline` `color`, `outlineColor`, and `outlineWidth` properties with a single `material` property.
  - Renamed `DynamicBillboard.nearFarScalar` to `DynamicBillboard.scaleByDistance`.
  - All data sources must now implement `DataSource.getName`, which returns a user-readable name for the data source.
  - CZML `document` objects are no longer added to the `DynamicObjectCollection` created by `CzmlDataSource`. Use the `CzmlDataSource` interface to access the data instead.
  - `TimeInterval.equals`, and `TimeInterval.equalsEpsilon` now compare interval data as well.
  - All SVG files were deleted from `Widgets/Images` and replaced by a new `SvgPath` class.
  - The toolbar widgets (Home, SceneMode, BaseLayerPicker) and the fullscreen button now depend on `CesiumWidget.css` for global Cesium button styles.
  - The toolbar widgets expect their `container` to be the toolbar itself now, no need for separate containers for each widget on the bar.
  - `Property` implementations are now required to implement a prototype `equals` function.
  - `ConstantProperty` and `TimeIntervalCollectionProperty` no longer take a `clone` function and instead require objects to implement prototype `clone` and `equals` functions.
  - The `SkyBox` constructor now takes an `options` argument with a `sources` property, instead of directly taking `sources`.
  - Replaced `SkyBox.getSources` with `SkyBox.sources`.
  - The `bearing` property of `DynamicEllipse` is now called `rotation`.
  - CZML `ellipse.bearing` property is now `ellipse.rotation`.
- Added a `Geocoder` widget that allows users to enter an address or the name of a landmark and zoom to that location. It is enabled by default in applications that use the `Viewer` widget.
- Added `GoogleEarthImageryProvider`.
- Added `Moon` for drawing the moon, and `IauOrientationAxes` for computing the Moon's orientation.
- Added `Material.translucent` property. Set this property or `Appearance.translucent` for correct rendering order. Translucent geometries are rendered after opaque geometries.
- Added `enableLighting`, `lightingFadeOutDistance`, and `lightingFadeInDistance` properties to `CentralBody` to configure lighting.
- Added `Billboard.setTranslucencyByDistance`, `Label.setTranslucencyByDistance`, `DynamicBillboard.translucencyByDistance`, and `DynamicLabel.translucencyByDistance` to control minimum/maximum translucency based on camera distance.
- Added `PolylineVolumeGeometry` and `PolylineVolumeGeometryOutline`.
- Added `Shapes.compute2DCircle`.
- Added `Appearances` tab to Sandcastle with an example for each geometry appearance.
- Added `Scene.drillPick` to return list of objects each containing 1 primitive at a screen space position.
- Added `PolylineOutlineMaterialProperty` for use with `DynamicPolyline.material`.
- Added the ability to use `Array` and `JulianDate` objects as custom CZML properties.
- Added `DynamicObject.name` and corresponding CZML support. This is a non-unique, user-readable name for the object.
- Added `DynamicObject.parent` and corresponding CZML support. This allows for `DataSource` objects to present data hierarchically.
- Added `DynamicPoint.scaleByDistance` to control minimum/maximum point size based on distance from the camera.
- The toolbar widgets (Home, SceneMode, BaseLayerPicker) and the fullscreen button can now be styled directly with user-supplied CSS.
- Added `skyBox` to the `CesiumWidget` and `Viewer` constructors for changing the default stars.
- Added `Matrix4.fromTranslationQuaternionRotationScale` and `Matrix4.multiplyByScale`.
- Added `Matrix3.getEigenDecomposition`.
- Added utility function `getFilenameFromUri`, which given a URI with or without query parameters, returns the last segment of the URL.
- Added prototype versions of `equals` and `equalsEpsilon` method back to `Cartesian2`, `Cartesian3`, `Cartesian4`, and `Quaternion`.
- Added prototype equals function to `NearFarScalar`, and `TimeIntervalCollection`.
- Added `FrameState.events`.

- Added `debugShowBoundingVolume`, for debugging primitive rendering, to `Primitive`, `Polygon`, `ExtentPrimitive`, `EllipsoidPrimitive`, `BillboardCollection`, `LabelCollection`, and `PolylineCollection`.
- Added `DebugModelMatrixPrimitive` for debugging primitive's `modelMatrix`.

- Upgraded Knockout from version 2.3.0 to 3.0.0.
- Upgraded RequireJS to version 2.1.9, and Almond to 0.2.6.
- Added a user-defined `id` to all primitives for use with picking. For example:

            primitives.add(new Polygon({
                id : {
                    // User-defined object returned by Scene.pick
                },
                // ...
            }));
            // ...
            var p = scene.pick(/* ... */);
            if (defined(p) && defined(p.id)) {
               // Use properties and functions in p.id
            }

### b21 - 2013-10-01

- Breaking changes:

  - Cesium now prints a reminder to the console if your application uses Bing Maps imagery and you do not supply a Bing Maps key for your application. This is a reminder that you should create a Bing Maps key for your application as soon as possible and prior to deployment. You can generate a Bing Maps key by visiting [https://www.bingmapsportal.com/](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/). Set the `BingMapsApi.defaultKey` property to the value of your application's key before constructing the `CesiumWidget` or any other types that use the Bing Maps API.

           BingMapsApi.defaultKey = 'my-key-generated-with-bingmapsportal.com';

  - `Scene.pick` now returns an object with a `primitive` property, not the primitive itself. For example, code that looked like:

           var primitive = scene.pick(/* ... */);
           if (defined(primitive)) {
              // Use primitive
           }

    should now look like:

           var p = scene.pick(/* ... */);
           if (defined(p) && defined(p.primitive)) {
              // Use p.primitive
           }

  - Removed `getViewMatrix`, `getInverseViewMatrix`, `getInverseTransform`, `getPositionWC`, `getDirectionWC`, `getUpWC` and `getRightWC` from `Camera`. Instead, use the `viewMatrix`, `inverseViewMatrix`, `inverseTransform`, `positionWC`, `directionWC`, `upWC`, and `rightWC` properties.
  - Removed `getProjectionMatrix` and `getInfiniteProjectionMatrix` from `PerspectiveFrustum`, `PerspectiveOffCenterFrustum` and `OrthographicFrustum`. Instead, use the `projectionMatrix` and `infiniteProjectionMatrix` properties.
  - The following prototype functions were removed:

    - From `Quaternion`: `conjugate`, `magnitudeSquared`, `magnitude`, `normalize`, `inverse`, `add`, `subtract`, `negate`, `dot`, `multiply`, `multiplyByScalar`, `divideByScalar`, `getAxis`, `getAngle`, `lerp`, `slerp`, `equals`, `equalsEpsilon`
    - From `Cartesian2`, `Cartesian3`, and `Cartesian4`: `getMaximumComponent`, `getMinimumComponent`, `magnitudeSquared`, `magnitude`, `normalize`, `dot`, `multiplyComponents`, `add`, `subtract`, `multiplyByScalar`, `divideByScalar`, `negate`, `abs`, `lerp`, `angleBetween`, `mostOrthogonalAxis`, `equals`, and `equalsEpsilon`.
    - From `Cartesian3`: `cross`

    Code that previously looked like `quaternion.magnitude();` should now look like `Quaternion.magnitude(quaternion);`.

  - `DynamicObjectCollection` and `CompositeDynamicObjectCollection` have been largely re-written, see the documentation for complete details. Highlights include:
    - `getObject` has been renamed `getById`.

- Breaking changes:

  - The `CameraFlightPath` functions `createAnimation`, `createAnimationCartographic`, and `createAnimationExtent` now take `scene` as their first parameter instead of `frameState`.
  - Completely refactored the `DynamicScene` property system to vastly improve the API. See [#1080](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/1080) for complete details.
    - Removed `CzmlBoolean`, `CzmlCartesian2`, `CzmlCartesian3`, `CzmlColor`, `CzmlDefaults`, `CzmlDirection`, `CzmlHorizontalOrigin`, `CzmlImage`, `CzmlLabelStyle`, `CzmlNumber`, `CzmlPosition`, `CzmlString`, `CzmlUnitCartesian3`, `CzmlUnitQuaternion`, `CzmlUnitSpherical`, and `CzmlVerticalOrigin` since they are no longer needed.

      - `Property` - base interface for all properties.
      - `CompositeProperty` - a property composed of other properties.
      - `ConstantProperty` - a property whose value never changes.
      - `SampledProperty` - a property whose value is interpolated from a set of samples.
      - `TimeIntervalCollectionProperty` - a property whose value changes based on time interval.
      - `MaterialProperty` - base interface for all material properties.
      - `CompositeMaterialProperty` - a `CompositeProperty` for materials.
      - `ColorMaterialProperty` - a property that maps to a color material. (replaces `DynamicColorMaterial`)
      - `GridMaterialProperty` - a property that maps to a grid material. (replaces `DynamicGridMaterial`)

      - `SampledPositionProperty` - a `SampledProperty` for positions.
      - `TimeIntervalCollectionPositionProperty` - A `TimeIntervalCollectionProperty` for positions.
  - Removed `processCzml`, use `CzmlDataSource` instead.
  - `Source/Widgets/Viewer/lighter.css` was deleted, use `Source/Widgets/lighter.css` instead.
  - Replaced `ExtentGeometry` parameters for extruded extent to make them consistent with other geometries.
    - `options.extrudedOptions.height` -> `options.extrudedHeight`
    - `options.extrudedOptions.closeTop` -> `options.closeBottom`
    - `options.extrudedOptions.closeBottom` -> `options.closeTop`
  - Geometry constructors no longer compute vertices or indices. Use the type's `createGeometry` method. For example, code that looked like:

          var boxGeometry = new BoxGeometry({
            minimumCorner : min,
            maximumCorner : max,
            vertexFormat : VertexFormat.POSITION_ONLY
          });

    should now look like:

          var box = new BoxGeometry({
              minimumCorner : min,
              maximumCorner : max,
              vertexFormat : VertexFormat.POSITION_ONLY
          });
          var geometry = BoxGeometry.createGeometry(box);

  - Removed `createTypedArray` and `createArrayBufferView` from each of the `ComponentDatatype` enumerations. Instead, use `ComponentDatatype.createTypedArray` and `ComponentDatatype.createArrayBufferView`.
  - `DataSourceDisplay` now requires a `DataSourceCollection` to be passed into its constructor.

- Improved `WallGeometry` to follow the curvature of the earth.
- Improved visual quality of closed translucent geometries.
- Optimized polyline bounding spheres.
- `Viewer` now automatically sets its clock to that of the first added `DataSource`, regardless of how it was added to the `DataSourceCollection`. Previously, this was only done for dropped files by `viewerDragDropMixin`.

### b18 - 2013-07-01

- Breaking changes:
  - Removed `CesiumViewerWidget` and replaced it with a new `Viewer` widget with mixin architecture. This new widget does not depend on Dojo and is part of the combined Cesium.js file. It is intended to be a flexible base widget for easily building robust applications. ([#838](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/838))
  - Changed all widgets to use ECMAScript 5 properties. All public observable properties now must be accessed and assigned as if they were normal properties, instead of being called as functions. For example:
    - `clockViewModel.shouldAnimate()` -> `clockViewModel.shouldAnimate`
    - `clockViewModel.shouldAnimate(true);` -> `clockViewModel.shouldAnimate = true;`
  - `ImageryProviderViewModel.fromConstants` has been removed. Use the `ImageryProviderViewModel` constructor directly.
  - Renamed the `transitioner` property on `CesiumWidget`, `HomeButton`, and `ScreenModePicker` to `sceneTrasitioner` to be consistent with property naming convention.
  - `ImageryProvider.loadImage` now requires that the calling imagery provider instance be passed as its first parameter.
  - Removed the Dojo-based `checkForChromeFrame` function, and replaced it with a new standalone version that returns a promise to signal when the asynchronous check has completed.
  - Removed `Assets/Textures/NE2_LR_LC_SR_W_DR_2048.jpg`. If you were previously using this image with `SingleTileImageryProvider`, consider instead using `TileMapServiceImageryProvider` with a URL of `Assets/Textures/NaturalEarthII`.
  - The `Client CZML` SandCastle demo has been removed, largely because it is redundant with the Simple CZML demo.
  - The `Two Viewer Widgets` SandCastle demo has been removed. We will add back a multi-scene example when we have a good architecture for it in place.
  - Changed static `clone` functions in all objects such that if the object being cloned is undefined, the function will return undefined instead of throwing an exception.
- Fix resizing issues in `CesiumWidget` ([#608](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/608), [#834](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/834)).
- Added initial support for [GeoJSON](http://www.geojson.org/) and [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson). ([#890](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/890), [#906](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/pull/906))
- Added rotation, aligned axis, width, and height properties to `Billboard`s.
- Improved the performance of "missing tile" checking, especially for Bing imagery.
- Improved the performance of terrain and imagery refinement, especially when using a mixture of slow and fast imagery sources.
- `TileMapServiceImageryProvider` now supports imagery with a minimum level. This improves compatibility with tile sets generated by MapTiler or gdal2tiles.py using their default settings.
- Added `Context.getAntialias`.
- Improved test robustness on Mac.
- Upgraded RequireJS to version 2.1.6, and Almond to 0.2.5.

- Fixed an issue in `BaseLayerPicker` where destroy wasn't properly cleaning everything up.
- Added the ability to unsubscribe to `Timeline` update event.
- Added a `screenSpaceEventHandler` property to `CesiumWidget`. Also added a `sceneMode` option to the constructor to set the initial scene mode.
- Added `useDefaultRenderLoop` property to `CesiumWidget` that allows the default render loop to be disabled so that a custom render loop can be used.
- Added `CesiumWidget.onRenderLoopError` which is an `Event` that is raised if an exception is generated inside of the default render loop.
- `ImageryProviderViewModel.creationCommand` can now return an array of ImageryProvider instances, which allows adding multiple layers when a single item is selected in the `BaseLayerPicker` widget.

### b17 - 2013-06-03

- Breaking changes:
  - Replaced `Uniform.getFrameNumber` and `Uniform.getTime` with `Uniform.getFrameState`, which returns the full frame state.
  - Renamed `Widgets/Fullscreen` folder to `Widgets/FullscreenButton` along with associated objects/files.
    - `FullscreenWidget` -> `FullscreenButton`
    - `FullscreenViewModel` -> `FullscreenButtonViewModel`
  - Removed `addAttribute`, `removeAttribute`, and `setIndexBuffer` from `VertexArray`. They were not used.
- Added support for approximating local vertical, local horizontal (LVLH) reference frames when using `DynamicObjectView` in 3D. The object automatically selects LVLH or EastNorthUp based on the object's velocity.
- Added support for CZML defined vectors via new `CzmlDirection`, `DynamicVector`, and `DynamicVectorVisualizer` objects.

- Added support for floating-point textures.
- Added `IntersectionTests.trianglePlaneIntersection`.
- Added `computeHorizonCullingPoint`, `computeHorizonCullingPointFromVertices`, and `computeHorizonCullingPointFromExtent` methods to `EllipsoidalOccluder` and used them to build a more accurate horizon occlusion test for terrain rendering.

- Added a new `HomeButton` widget for returning to the default view of the current scene mode.
- Added `Command.beforeExecute` and `Command.afterExecute` events to enable additional processing when a command is executed.
- Added rotation parameter to `Polygon.configureExtent`.
- Added camera flight to extents. See new methods `CameraController.getExtentCameraCoordinates` and `CameraFlightPath.createAnimationExtent`.
- Improved the load ordering of terrain and imagery tiles, so that relevant detail is now more likely to be loaded first.
- Improved appearance of the Polyline arrow material.
- Fixed polyline clipping artifact. [#728](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/728).
- Fixed polygon crossing International Date Line for 2D and Columbus view. [#99](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/issues/99).

- Fixed ISO8601 date parsing when UTC offset is specified in the extended format, such as `2008-11-10T14:00:00+02:30`.

### b16 - 2013-05-01

- Breaking changes:

  - Removed the color, outline color, and outline width properties of polylines. Instead, use materials for polyline color and outline properties. Code that looked like:

           var polyline = polylineCollection.add({
               positions : positions,
               color : new Color(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0),
               outlineColor : new Color(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0),
               width : 1.0,
               outlineWidth : 3.0
           });

    should now look like:

           var outlineMaterial = Material.fromType(context, Material.PolylineOutlineType);
           outlineMaterial.uniforms.color = new Color(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
           outlineMaterial.uniforms.outlineColor = new Color(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
           outlineMaterial.uniforms.outlinewidth = 2.0;

           var polyline = polylineCollection.add({
               positions : positions,
               width : 3.0,
               material : outlineMaterial
           });

  - `CzmlCartographic` has been removed and all cartographic values are converted to Cartesian internally during CZML processing. This improves performance and fixes interpolation of cartographic source data. The Cartographic representation can still be retrieved if needed.
  - Removed `ComplexConicSensorVolume`, which was not documented and did not work on most platforms. It will be brought back in a future release. This does not affect CZML, which uses a custom sensor to approximate a complex conic.
  - Replaced `computeSunPosition` with `Simon1994PlanetaryPosition`, which has functions to calculate the position of the sun and the moon more accurately.
  - Removed `Context.createClearState`. These properties are now part of `ClearCommand`.
  - `RenderState` objects returned from `Context.createRenderState` are now immutable.
  - Removed `positionMC` from `czm_materialInput`. It is no longer used by any materials.

- Added wide polylines that work with and without ANGLE.
- Polylines now use materials to describe their surface appearance. See the [Fabric](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/wiki/Fabric) wiki page for more details on how to create materials.
- Added new `PolylineOutline`, `PolylineGlow`, `PolylineArrow`, and `Fade` materials.
- Added `czm_pixelSizeInMeters` automatic GLSL uniform.
- Added `AnimationViewModel.snapToTicks`, which when set to true, causes the shuttle ring on the Animation widget to snap to the defined tick values, rather than interpolate between them.
- Added `Color.toRgba` and `Color.fromRgba` to convert to/from numeric unsigned 32-bit RGBA values.
- Added `GridImageryProvider` for custom rendering effects and debugging.
- Added new `Grid` material.
- Made `EllipsoidPrimitive` double-sided.
- Improved rendering performance by minimizing WebGL state calls.
- Fixed an error in Web Worker creation when loading Cesium.js from a different origin.
- Fixed `EllipsoidPrimitive` picking and picking objects with materials that have transparent parts.
- Fixed imagery smearing artifacts on mobile devices and other devices without high-precision fragment shaders.

### b15 - 2013-04-01

- Breaking changes:
  - `Billboard.computeScreenSpacePosition` now takes `Context` and `FrameState` arguments instead of a `UniformState` argument.
  - Removed `clampToPixel` property from `BillboardCollection` and `LabelCollection`. This option is no longer needed due to overall LabelCollection visualization improvements.
  - Removed `Widgets/Dojo/CesiumWidget` and replaced it with `Widgets/CesiumWidget`, which has no Dojo dependancies.
  - `destroyObject` no longer deletes properties from the object being destroyed.
  - `darker.css` files have been deleted and the `darker` theme is now the default style for widgets. The original theme is now known as `lighter` and is in corresponding `lighter.css` files.
  - CSS class names have been standardized to avoid potential collisions. All widgets now follow the same pattern, `cesium-<widget>-<className>`.
  - Removed `view2D`, `view3D`, and `viewColumbus` properties from `CesiumViewerWidget`. Use the `sceneTransitioner` property instead.
- Added `BoundingSphere.fromCornerPoints`.
- Added `fromArray` and `distance` functions to `Cartesian2`, `Cartesian3`, and `Cartesian4`.
- Added `DynamicPath.resolution` property for setting the maximum step size, in seconds, to take when sampling a position for path visualization.
- Added `TileCoordinatesImageryProvider` that renders imagery with tile X, Y, Level coordinates on the surface of the globe. This is mostly useful for debugging.
- Added `DynamicEllipse` and `DynamicObject.ellipse` property to render CZML ellipses on the globe.
- Added `sampleTerrain` function to sample the terrain height of a list of `Cartographic` positions.
- Added `DynamicObjectCollection.removeObject` and handling of the new CZML `delete` property.
- Imagery layers with an `alpha` of exactly 0.0 are no longer rendered. Previously these invisible layers were rendered normally, which was a waste of resources. Unlike the `show` property, imagery tiles in a layer with an `alpha` of 0.0 are still downloaded, so the layer will become visible more quickly when its `alpha` is increased.
- Added `onTransitionStart` and `onTransitionComplete` events to `SceneModeTransitioner`.
- Added `SceneModePicker`; a new widget for morphing between scene modes.
- Added `BaseLayerPicker`; a new widget for switching among pre-configured base layer imagery providers.

### b14 - 2013-03-01

    - `Clock.shouldAnimate` was added to indicate if `Clock.tick` should actually advance time.
    - The Timeline widget was moved into the Widgets/Timeline subdirectory.
    - `Dojo/TimelineWidget` was removed. You should use the non-toolkit specific Timeline widget directly.
  - Removed `CesiumViewerWidget.fullScreenElement`, instead use the `CesiumViewerWidget.fullscreen.viewModel.fullScreenElement` observable property.
  - `IntersectionTests.rayPlane` now takes the new `Plane` type instead of separate `planeNormal` and `planeD` arguments.
  - Renamed `ImageryProviderError` to `TileProviderError`.
- Added support for global terrain visualization via `CesiumTerrainProvider`, `ArcGisImageServerTerrainProvider`, and `VRTheWorldTerrainProvider`. See the [Terrain Tutorial](http://cesiumjs.org/2013/02/15/Cesium-Terrain-Tutorial/) for more information.
- Added `FullscreenWidget` which is a simple, single-button widget that toggles fullscreen mode of the specified element.
- Added interactive extent drawing to the `Picking` Sandcastle example.
- Added `HeightmapTessellator` to create a mesh from a heightmap.
- Added `JulianDate.equals`.
- Added `Plane` for representing the equation of a plane.
- Added a line segment-plane intersection test to `IntersectionTests`.
- Improved the lighting used in 2D and Columbus View modes. In general, the surface lighting in these modes should look just like it does in 3D.
- Fixed an issue where a `PolylineCollection` with a model matrix other than the identity would be incorrectly rendered in 2D and Columbus view.
- Fixed an issue in the `ScreenSpaceCameraController` where disabled mouse events can cause the camera to be moved after being re-enabled.

  - Removed `erosion` property from `Polygon`, `ComplexConicSensorVolume`, `RectangularPyramidSensorVolume`, and `ComplexConicSensorVolume`. Use the new `Erosion` material. See the Sandbox Animation example.
  - Removed `setRectangle` and `getRectangle` methods from `ViewportQuad`. Use the new `rectangle` property.
  - Removed `time` parameter from `Scene.initializeFrame`. Instead, pass the time to `Scene.render`.

- Added `hue` and `saturation` properties to `ImageryLayer`.
- Added `czm_hue` and `czm_saturation` to adjust the hue and saturation of RGB colors.
- Added `JulianDate.getDaysDifference` method.
- Added `Transforms.computeIcrfToFixedMatrix` and `computeFixedToIcrfMatrix`.
- Added `EarthOrientationParameters`, `EarthOrientationParametersSample`, `Iau2006XysData`, and `Iau2006XysDataSample` classes to `Core`.

- Updated Dojo from 1.7.2 to 1.8.4. Reminder: Cesium does not depend on Dojo but uses it for reference applications.

### b12a - 2013-01-18

- Breaking changes:

  - Renamed the `server` property to `url` when constructing a `BingMapsImageryProvider`. Likewise, renamed `BingMapsImageryProvider.getServer` to `BingMapsImageryProvider.getUrl`. Code that looked like

           var bing = new BingMapsImageryProvider({
               server : 'dev.virtualearth.net'
           });

    should now look like:

           var bing = new BingMapsImageryProvider({
               url : 'http://dev.virtualearth.net'
           });

  - Renamed `toCSSColor` to `toCssColorString`.

### b12 - 2013-01-03

- Breaking changes:
  - Renamed `EventHandler` to `ScreenSpaceEventHandler`.
  - Renamed `MouseEventType` to `ScreenSpaceEventType`.
  - Renamed `MouseEventType.MOVE` to `ScreenSpaceEventType.MOUSE_MOVE`.
  - Renamed `CameraEventHandler` to `CameraEventAggregator`.
  - Renamed all `*MouseAction` to `*InputAction` (including get, set, remove, etc).
  - Removed `Camera2DController`, `CameraCentralBodyController`, `CameraColumbusViewController`, `CameraFlightController`, `CameraFreeLookController`, `CameraSpindleController`, and `CameraControllerCollection`. Common ways to modify the camera are through the `CameraController` object of the `Camera` and will work in all scene modes. The default camera handler is the `ScreenSpaceCameraController` object on the `Scene`.
  - Changed default Natural Earth imagery to a 2K version of [Natural Earth II with Shaded Relief, Water, and Drainages](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-raster-data/10m-natural-earth-2/). The previously used version did not include lakes and rivers. This replaced `Source/Assets/Textures/NE2_50M_SR_W_2048.jpg` with `Source/Assets/Textures/NE2_LR_LC_SR_W_DR_2048.jpg`.
- Added pinch-zoom, pinch-twist, and pinch-tilt for touch-enabled browsers (particularly mobile browsers).
- Improved rendering support on Nexus 4 and Nexus 7 using Firefox.
- Improved camera flights.
- Added Sandbox example using NASA's new [Black Marble](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/news/earth-at-night.html) night imagery.
- Added constrained z-axis by default to the Cesium widgets.
- Upgraded Jasmine from version 1.1.0 to 1.3.0.
- Added `JulianDate.toIso8601`, which creates an ISO8601 compliant representation of a JulianDate.
- The `Timeline` widget now properly displays leap seconds.

### b11 - 2012-12-03

- Breaking changes:
  - Widget render loop now started by default. Startup code changed, see Sandcastle examples.
  - Changed `Timeline.makeLabel` to take a `JulianDate` instead of a JavaScript date parameter.
  - Default Earth imagery has been moved to a new package `Assets`. Images used by `Sandcastle` examples have been moved to the Sandcastle folder, and images used by the Dojo widgets are now self-contained in the `Widgets` package.
  - `positionToEyeEC` in `czm_materialInput` is no longer normalized by default.
  - `FullScreen` and related functions have been renamed to `Fullscreen` to match the W3C standard name.
  - `Fullscreen.isFullscreenEnabled` was incorrectly implemented in certain browsers. `isFullscreenEnabled` now correctly determines whether the browser will allow an element to go fullscreen. A new `isFullscreen` function is available to determine if the browser is currently in fullscreen mode.
  - `Fullscreen.getFullScreenChangeEventName` and `Fullscreen.getFullScreenChangeEventName` now return the proper event name, suitable for use with the `addEventListener` API, instead prefixing them with "on".
  - Removed `Scene.setSunPosition` and `Scene.getSunPosition`. The sun position used for lighting is automatically computed based on the scene's time.
  - Removed a number of rendering options from `CentralBody`, including the ground atmosphere, night texture, specular map, cloud map, cloud shadows, and bump map. These features weren't really production ready and had a disproportionate cost in terms of shader complexity and compilation time. They may return in a more polished form in a future release.
  - Removed `affectedByLighting` property from `Polygon`, `EllipsoidPrimitive`, `RectangularPyramidSensorVolume`, `CustomSensorVolume`, and `ComplexConicSensorVolume`.
  - Removed `DistanceIntervalMaterial`. This was not documented.
  - `Matrix2.getElementIndex`, `Matrix3.getElementIndex`, and `Matrix4.getElementIndex` functions have had their parameters swapped and now take row first and column second. This is consistent with other class constants, such as Matrix2.COLUMN1ROW2.
  - Replaced `CentralBody.showSkyAtmosphere` with `Scene.skyAtmosphere` and `SkyAtmosphere`. This has no impact for those using the Cesium widget.
- Improved lighting in Columbus view and on polygons, ellipsoids, and sensors.
- Fixed atmosphere rendering artifacts and improved Columbus view transition.
- Fixed jitter artifacts with billboards and polylines.
- Added `TileMapServiceImageryProvider`. See the Imagery Layers `Sandcastle` example.
- Added `Water` material. See the Materials `Sandcastle` example.
- Added `SkyBox` to draw stars. Added `CesiumWidget.showSkyBox` and `CesiumViewerWidget.showSkyBox`.
- Added new `Matrix4` functions: `Matrix4.multiplyByTranslation`, `multiplyByPoint`, and `Matrix4.fromScale`. Added `Matrix3.fromScale`.
- Added `EncodedCartesian3`, which is used to eliminate jitter when drawing primitives.
- Added new automatic GLSL uniforms: `czm_frameNumber`, `czm_temeToPseudoFixed`, `czm_entireFrustum`, `czm_inverseModel`, `czm_modelViewRelativeToEye`, `czm_modelViewProjectionRelativeToEye`, `czm_encodedCameraPositionMCHigh`, and `czm_encodedCameraPositionMCLow`.
- Added `czm_translateRelativeToEye` and `czm_luminance` GLSL functions.
- Added `shininess` to `czm_materialInput`.
- Added `QuadraticRealPolynomial`, `CubicRealPolynomial`, and `QuarticRealPolynomial` for finding the roots of quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomials.
- Added `IntersectionTests.grazingAltitudeLocation` for finding a point on a ray nearest to an ellipsoid.
- Added `mostOrthogonalAxis` function to `Cartesian2`, `Cartesian3`, and `Cartesian4`.
- Changed CesiumViewerWidget default behavior so that zooming to an object now requires a single left-click, rather than a double-click.
- Updated third-party [Tween.js](https://github.com/sole/tween.js/).

### b10 - 2012-11-02

- Breaking changes:
  - Renamed `Texture2DPool` to `TexturePool`.
  - Renamed `BingMapsTileProvider` to `BingMapsImageryProvider`.
  - Renamed `SingleTileProvider` to `SingleTileImageryProvider`.
  - Renamed `ArcGISTileProvider` to `ArcGisMapServerImageryProvider`.
  - Renamed `EquidistantCylindrdicalProjection` to `GeographicProjection`.
  - Renamed `MercatorProjection` to `WebMercatorProjection`.
  - `CentralBody.dayTileProvider` has been removed. Instead, add one or more imagery providers to the collection returned by `CentralBody.getImageryLayers()`.
  - The `description.generateTextureCoords` parameter passed to `ExtentTessellator.compute` is now called `description.generateTextureCoordinates`.
  - Renamed `bringForward`, `sendBackward`, `bringToFront`, and `sendToBack` methods on `CompositePrimitive` to `raise`, `lower`, `raiseToTop`, and `lowerToBottom`, respectively.
  - `Cache` and `CachePolicy` are no longer used and have been removed.
  - Fixed problem with Dojo widget startup, and removed "postSetup" callback in the process. See Sandcastle examples and update your startup code.
- `CentralBody` now allows imagery from multiple sources to be layered and alpha blended on the globe. See the new `Imagery Layers` and `Map Projections` Sandcastle examples.
- Added `WebMapServiceImageryProvider`.
- Improved middle mouse click behavior to always tilt in the same direction.
- Added `getElementIndex` to `Matrix2`, `Matrix3`, and `Matrix4`.

### b9 - 2012-10-01

- Breaking changes:
  - Removed the `render` and `renderForPick` functions of primitives. The primitive `update` function updates a list of commands for the renderer. For more details, see the [Data Driven Renderer](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/wiki/Data-Driven-Renderer-Details).
  - Removed `Context.getViewport` and `Context.setViewport`. The viewport defaults to the size of the canvas if a primitive does not override the viewport property in the render state.
  - `shallowEquals` has been removed.
  - Passing `undefined` to any of the set functions on `Billboard` now throws an exception.
  - Passing `undefined` to any of the set functions on `Polyline` now throws an exception.
  - `PolygonPipeline.scaleToGeodeticHeight` now takes ellipsoid as the last parameter, instead of the first. It also now defaults to `Ellipsoid.WGS84` if no parameter is provided.
- The new Sandcastle live editor and demo gallery replace the Sandbox and Skeleton examples.
- Improved picking performance and accuracy.
- Added EllipsoidPrimitive for visualizing ellipsoids and spheres. Currently, this is only supported in 3D, not 2D or Columbus view.
- Added `DynamicEllipsoid` and `DynamicEllipsoidVisualizer` which use the new `EllipsoidPrimitive` to implement ellipsoids in CZML.
- `Extent` functions now take optional result parameters. Also added `getCenter`, `intersectWith`, and `contains` functions.
- Add new utility class, `DynamicObjectView` for tracking a DynamicObject with the camera across scene modes; also hooked up CesiumViewerWidget to use it.
- Added `enableTranslate`, `enableZoom`, and `enableRotate` properties to `Camera2DController` to selectively toggle camera behavior. All values default to `true`.
- Added `Camera2DController.setPositionCartographic` to simplify moving the camera programmatically when in 2D mode.
- Improved near/far plane distances and eliminated z-fighting.
- Added `Matrix4.multiplyByTranslation`, `Matrix4.fromScale`, and `Matrix3.fromScale`.

### b8 - 2012-09-05

- Breaking changes:

  - Materials are now created through a centralized Material class using a JSON schema called [Fabric](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/wiki/Fabric). For example, change:

          polygon.material = new BlobMaterial({repeat : 10.0});

    to:

          polygon.material = Material.fromType(context, 'Blob');
          polygon.material.repeat = 10.0;

    or:

          polygon.material = new Material({
              context : context,
              fabric : {
                  type : 'Blob',
                  uniforms : {
                      repeat : 10.0
                  }
              }
          });

  - `Label.computeScreenSpacePosition` now requires the current scene state as a parameter.
  - Passing `undefined` to any of the set functions on `Label` now throws an exception.
  - Renamed `agi_` prefix on GLSL identifiers to `czm_`.
  - Replaced `ViewportQuad` properties `vertexShader` and `fragmentShader` with optional constructor arguments.
  - Changed the GLSL automatic uniform `czm_viewport` from an `ivec4` to a `vec4` to reduce casting.
  - `Billboard` now defaults to an image index of `-1` indicating no texture, previously billboards defaulted to `0` indicating the first texture in the atlas. For example, change:

          billboards.add({
              position : { x : 1.0, y : 2.0, z : 3.0 },
          });

    to:

          billboards.add({
              position : { x : 1.0, y : 2.0, z : 3.0 },
              imageIndex : 0
          });

  - Renamed `SceneState` to `FrameState`.
  - `SunPosition` was changed from a static object to a function `computeSunPosition`; which now returns a `Cartesian3` with the computed position. It was also optimized for performance and memory pressure. For example, change:

          var result = SunPosition.compute(date);
          var position = result.position;

        to:

          var position = computeSunPosition(date);

- All `Quaternion` operations now have static versions that work with any objects exposing `x`, `y`, `z` and `w` properties.
- Added support for nested polygons with holes. See `Polygon.configureFromPolygonHierarchy`.
- Added support to the renderer for view frustum and central body occlusion culling. All built-in primitives, such as `BillboardCollection`, `Polygon`, `PolylineCollection`, etc., can be culled. See the advanced examples in the Sandbox for details.
- Added `writeTextToCanvas` function which handles sizing the resulting canvas to fit the desired text.
- Added support for CZML path visualization via the `DynamicPath` and `DynamicPathVisualizer` objects. See the [CZML wiki](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/wiki/CZML-Guide) for more details.
- Added support for [WEBGL_depth_texture](http://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/WEBGL_depth_texture/). See `Framebuffer.setDepthTexture`.
- Added `CesiumMath.isPowerOfTwo`.
- Added `affectedByLighting` to `ComplexConicSensorVolume`, `CustomSensorVolume`, and `RectangularPyramidSensorVolume` to turn lighting on/off for these objects.
- CZML `Polygon`, `Cone`, and `Pyramid` objects are no longer affected by lighting.
- Added `czm_viewRotation` and `czm_viewInverseRotation` automatic GLSL uniforms.
- Added a `clampToPixel` property to `BillboardCollection` and `LabelCollection`. When true, it aligns all billboards and text to a pixel in screen space, providing a crisper image at the cost of jumpier motion.
- `Ellipsoid` functions now take optional result parameters.

### b7 - 2012-08-01

- Breaking changes:

  - Removed keyboard input handling from `EventHandler`.
  - `TextureAtlas` takes an object literal in its constructor instead of separate parameters. Code that previously looked like:

          context.createTextureAtlas(images, pixelFormat, borderWidthInPixels);

    should now look like:

          context.createTextureAtlas({images : images, pixelFormat : pixelFormat, borderWidthInPixels : borderWidthInPixels});

  - `Camera.pickEllipsoid` returns the picked position in world coordinates and the ellipsoid parameter is optional. Prefer the new `Scene.pickEllipsoid` method. For example, change

          var position = camera.pickEllipsoid(ellipsoid, windowPosition);

    to:

          var position = scene.pickEllipsoid(windowPosition, ellipsoid);

  - `Camera.getPickRay` now returns the new `Ray` type instead of an object with position and direction properties.
  - `Camera.viewExtent` now takes an `Extent` argument instead of west, south, east and north arguments. Prefer `Scene.viewExtent` over `Camera.viewExtent`. `Scene.viewExtent` will work in any `SceneMode`. For example, change

          camera.viewExtent(ellipsoid, west, south, east, north);

    to:

          scene.viewExtent(extent, ellipsoid);

  - `CameraSpindleController.mouseConstrainedZAxis` has been removed. Instead, use `CameraSpindleController.constrainedAxis`. Code that previously looked like:

          spindleController.mouseConstrainedZAxis = true;

    should now look like:

          spindleController.constrainedAxis = Cartesian3.UNIT_Z;

  - The `Camera2DController` constructor and `CameraControllerCollection.add2D` now require a projection instead of an ellipsoid.
  - `Chain` has been removed. `when` is now included as a more complete CommonJS Promises/A implementation.
  - `Jobs.downloadImage` was replaced with `loadImage` to provide a promise that will asynchronously load an image.
  - `jsonp` now returns a promise for the requested data, removing the need for a callback parameter.
  - JulianDate.getTimeStandard() has been removed, dates are now always stored internally as TAI.
  - LeapSeconds.setLeapSeconds now takes an array of LeapSecond instances instead of JSON.
  - TimeStandard.convertUtcToTai and TimeStandard.convertTaiToUtc have been removed as they are no longer needed.
  - `Cartesian3.prototype.getXY()` was replaced with `Cartesian2.fromCartesian3`. Code that previously looked like `cartesian3.getXY();` should now look like `Cartesian2.fromCartesian3(cartesian3);`.
  - `Cartesian4.prototype.getXY()` was replaced with `Cartesian2.fromCartesian4`. Code that previously looked like `cartesian4.getXY();` should now look like `Cartesian2.fromCartesian4(cartesian4);`.
  - `Cartesian4.prototype.getXYZ()` was replaced with `Cartesian3.fromCartesian4`. Code that previously looked like `cartesian4.getXYZ();` should now look like `Cartesian3.fromCartesian4(cartesian4);`.
  - `Math.angleBetween` was removed because it was a duplicate of `Cartesian3.angleBetween`. Simply replace calls of the former to the later.
  - `Cartographic3` was renamed to `Cartographic`.
  - `Cartographic2` was removed; use `Cartographic` instead.
  - `Ellipsoid.toCartesian` was renamed to `Ellipsoid.cartographicToCartesian`.
  - `Ellipsoid.toCartesians` was renamed to `Ellipsoid.cartographicArrayToCartesianArray`.
  - `Ellipsoid.toCartographic2` was renamed to `Ellipsoid.cartesianToCartographic`.
  - `Ellipsoid.toCartographic2s` was renamed to `Ellipsoid.cartesianArrayToCartographicArray`.
  - `Ellipsoid.toCartographic3` was renamed to `Ellipsoid.cartesianToCartographic`.
  - `Ellipsoid.toCartographic3s` was renamed to `Ellipsoid.cartesianArrayToCartographicArray`.
  - `Ellipsoid.cartographicDegreesToCartesian` was removed. Code that previously looked like `ellipsoid.cartographicDegreesToCartesian(new Cartographic(45, 50, 10))` should now look like `ellipsoid.cartographicToCartesian(Cartographic.fromDegrees(45, 50, 10))`.
  - `Math.cartographic3ToRadians`, `Math.cartographic2ToRadians`, `Math.cartographic2ToDegrees`, and `Math.cartographic3ToDegrees` were removed. These functions are no longer needed because Cartographic instances are always represented in radians.
  - All functions starting with `multiplyWith` now start with `multiplyBy` to be consistent with functions starting with `divideBy`.
  - The `multiplyWithMatrix` function on each `Matrix` type was renamed to `multiply`.
  - All three Matrix classes have been largely re-written for consistency and performance. The `values` property has been eliminated and Matrices are no longer immutable. Code that previously looked like `matrix = matrix.setColumn0Row0(12);` now looks like `matrix[Matrix2.COLUMN0ROW0] = 12;`. Code that previously looked like `matrix.setColumn3(cartesian3);` now looked like `matrix.setColumn(3, cartesian3, matrix)`.
  - 'Polyline' is no longer externally creatable. To create a 'Polyline' use the 'PolylineCollection.add' method.

          Polyline polyline = new Polyline();

    to

          PolylineCollection polylineCollection = new PolylineCollection();
          Polyline polyline = polylineCollection.add();

- All `Cartesian2` operations now have static versions that work with any objects exposing `x` and `y` properties.

- Added `Cartographic.fromDegrees` to make creating Cartographic instances from values in degrees easier.
- Added `addImage` to `TextureAtlas` so images can be added to a texture atlas after it is constructed.
- Added `Scene.pickEllipsoid`, which picks either the ellipsoid or the map depending on the current `SceneMode`.
- Added `Event`, a new utility class which makes it easy for objects to expose event properties.
- Added `TextureAtlasBuilder`, a new utility class which makes it easy to build a TextureAtlas asynchronously.
- Added `Clock`, a simple clock for keeping track of simulated time.
- Added `LagrangePolynomialApproximation`, `HermitePolynomialApproximation`, and `LinearApproximation` interpolation algorithms.
- Added `CoordinateConversions`, a new static class where most coordinate conversion methods will be stored.
- Added `Spherical` coordinate type

  - `CompositePrimitive.addGround` was removed; use `CompositePrimitive.add` instead. For example, change

          primitives.addGround(polygon);

    to:

          primitives.add(polygon);

  - Moved `eastNorthUpToFixedFrame` and `northEastDownToFixedFrame` functions from `Ellipsoid` to a new `Transforms` object. For example, change

          var m = ellipsoid.eastNorthUpToFixedFrame(p);

    to:

          var m = Cesium.Transforms.eastNorthUpToFixedFrame(p, ellipsoid);

  - Label properties `fillStyle` and `strokeStyle` were renamed to `fillColor` and `outlineColor`; they are also now color objects instead of strings. The label `Color` property has been removed.

    For example, change

          label.setFillStyle("red");
          label.setStrokeStyle("#FFFFFFFF");

    to:

          label.setFillColor({ red : 1.0, blue : 0.0, green : 0.0, alpha : 1.0 });
          label.setOutlineColor({ red : 1.0, blue : 1.0, green : 1.0, alpha : 1.0 });

  - `TWEEN` is no longer globally defined, and is instead available as `Cesium.Tween`.
  - Chain.js functions such as `run` are now moved to `Cesium.Chain.run`, etc.
  - `Geoscope.CollectionAlgorithms.binarySearch` is now `Cesium.binarySearch`.
  - `Geoscope.ContainmentTests.pointInsideTriangle2D` is now `Cesium.pointInsideTriangle2D`.
  - Static constructor methods prefixed with "createFrom", now start with "from":

          Matrix2.createfromColumnMajorArray

    becomes

          Matrix2.fromColumnMajorArray

  - The `JulianDate` constructor no longer takes a `Date` object, use the new from methods instead:

          new JulianDate(new Date());

    becomes

          JulianDate.fromDate(new Date("January 1, 2011 12:00:00 EST"));
          JulianDate.fromIso8601("2012-04-24T18:08Z");
          JulianDate.fromTotalDays(23452.23);

  - `JulianDate.getDate` is now `JulianDate.toDate()` and returns a new instance each time.
  - `CentralBody.logoOffsetX` and `logoOffsetY` have been replaced with `CentralBody.logoOffset`, a `Cartesian2`.
  - TileProviders now take a proxy object instead of a string, to allow more control over how proxy URLs are built. Construct a DefaultProxy, passing the previous proxy URL, to get the previous behavior.
  - `Ellipsoid.getScaledWgs84()` has been removed since it is not needed.
  - `getXXX()` methods which returned a new instance of what should really be a constant are now exposed as frozen properties instead. This should improve performance and memory pressure.

### b2 - 2011-12-01

- Added complex conic and custom sensor volumes, and various materials to change their appearance. See the new Sensor folder in the Sandbox.
- Added modelMatrix property to primitives to render them in a local reference frame. See the polyline example in the Sandbox.
- Added eastNorthUpToFixedFrame() and northEastDownToFixedFrame() to Ellipsoid to create local reference frames.
- Added CameraFlightController to zoom smoothly from one point to another. See the new camera examples in the Sandbox.
- Added row and column assessors to Matrix2, Matrix3, and Matrix4.
- Added Scene, which reduces the amount of code required to use Geoscope. See the Skeleton. We recommend using this instead of explicitly calling update() and render() for individual or composite primitives. Existing code will need minor changes:

  - Calls to Context.pick() should be replaced with Scene.pick().
  - Primitive constructors no longer require a context argument.
  - Primitive update() and render() functions now require a context argument. However, when using the new Scene object, these functions do not need to be called directly.
  - TextureAtlas should no longer be created directly; instead, call Scene.getContext().createTextureAtlas().
  - Other breaking changes:

    - Camera get/set functions, e.g., getPosition/setPosition were replaced with properties, e.g., position.
    - Replaced CompositePrimitive, Polygon, and Polyline getShow/setShow functions with a show property.
    - Replaced Polyline, Polygon, BillboardCollection, and LabelCollection getBufferUsage/setBufferUsage functions with a bufferUsage property.
    - Changed colors used by billboards, labels, polylines, and polygons. Previously, components were named r, g, b, and a. They are now red, green, blue, and alpha. Previously, each component's range was [0, 255]. The range is now [0, 1] floating point. For example,

            color : { r : 0, g : 255, b : 0, a : 255 }

      becomes:

            color : { red : 0.0, green : 1.0, blue : 0.0, alpha : 1.0 }

### b1 - 2011-09-19

- Added `Shapes.computeCircleBoundary` to compute circles. See the Sandbox.
- Changed the `EventHandler` constructor function to take the Geoscope canvas, which ensures the mouse position is correct regardless of the canvas' position on the page. Code that previously looked like:

        var handler = new Geoscope.EventHandler();

  should now look like:

        var handler = new Geoscope.EventHandler(canvas);

- Context.Pick no longer requires clamping the x and y arguments. Code that previously looked like:

        var pickedObject = context.pick(primitives, us, Math.max(x, 0.0),
            Math.max(context.getCanvas().clientHeight - y, 0.0));

  can now look like:

        var pickedObject = context.pick(primitives, us, x, context.getCanvas().clientHeight - y);

- Changed Polyline.setWidth and Polyline.setOutlineWidth to clamp the width to the WebGL implementation limit instead of throwing an exception. Code that previously looked like:

        var maxWidth = context.getMaximumAliasedLineWidth();
        polyline.setWidth(Math.min(5, maxWidth));
        polyline.setOutlineWidth(Math.min(10, maxWidth));

  can now look like:

        polyline.setWidth(5);
        polyline.setOutlineWidth(10);

- Improved the Sandbox:
  - Code in the editor is now evaluated as you type for quick prototyping.
  - Highlighting a Geoscope type in the editor and clicking the doc button in the toolbar now brings up the reference help for that type.
- BREAKING CHANGE: The `Context` constructor-function now takes an element instead of an ID. Code that previously looked like:

        var context = new Geoscope.Context("glCanvas");
        var canvas = context.getCanvas();

  should now look like:

        var canvas = document.getElementById("glCanvas");
        var context = new Geoscope.Context(canvas);

### b0 - 2011-08-31

- Added new Sandbox and Skeleton examples. The sandbox contains example code for common tasks. The skeleton is a bare-bones application for building upon. Most sandbox code examples can be copy and pasted directly into the skeleton.
- Added `Geoscope.Polygon` for drawing polygons on the globe.
- Added `Context.pick` to pick objects in one line of code.
- Added `bringForward`, `bringToFront`, `sendBackward`, and `sendToBack` functions to `CompositePrimitive` to control the render-order for ground primitives.
- Added `getShow`/`setShow` functions to `Polyline` and `CompositePrimitive`.
- Added new camera control and event types including `CameraFreeLookEventHandler`, `CameraSpindleEventHandler`, and `EventHandler`.
- Replaced `Ellipsoid.toCartesian3` with `Ellipsoid.toCartesian`.
- update and `updateForPick` functions no longer require a `UniformState` argument.
