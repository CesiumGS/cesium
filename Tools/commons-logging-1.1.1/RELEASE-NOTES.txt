                           Commons Logging Package
                                Version 1.1.1
                                Release Notes

INTRODUCTION:
============

This release of Apache Commons Logging is a maintenance release, with just a
couple of fixes for using Commons Logging under restrictive security policies.

All core classes were compiled with Maven using a 1.4.x JDK, with target set
to 1.1 and source set to 1.2. Commons Logging may work on some
augmented 1.1 series JREs but it is recommended that those wish to run
on 1.1 JREs download the source and create a custom implementation by
stripping out all the complex classloader management code.

For further details, please see the Apache Commons Logging website:
  http://commons.apache.org/logging/

For the very latest news, hints, FAQs etc. please see the
Apache Commons Logging wiki site:
  http://wiki.apache.org/commons/Logging

Note that some containers (some versions of Apache Tomcat and JBoss in
particular) prevent webapps, ejbs, etc from overriding the commons-logging
implementation provided by the container. This means that bundling this
updated implementation with a deployed application may not have any effect.
See the commons-logging site and/or the wiki for more information.

== New Features Since 1.1.0 ==

None.

== Incompatibilities ==

The protected method LogFactory.getContextClassLoader has been reverted to pre-1.1
behaviour. In earlier releases, this method did not use an AccessController when
obtaining the context classloader. In version 1.1 it did. In this release, it has
reverted to not using an AccessController; any user-level code that needs to obtain
a context classloader should itself create an AccessController, and call the
LogFactory.getContextClassLoader method via the doPrivileged method. This fixes a
potential security issue, where untrusted code could get access to the context
classloader if a signed Commons Logging library was in the classpath.

== Dependencies ==

Commons Logging has no mandatory dependencies.

Java 1.2 and later are supported. It may be possible to use this release with
java 1.1 but this has not been tested; the unit tests certainly don't run on
that version.

== Distributed Jar Files ==

File commons-logging-nn.jar is the one most people will want. It provides the
base implementation and adapters to a number of popular logging libraries.

File commons-logging-adapters-nn.jar includes only the adapters to various
concrete logging libraries. When commons-logging-nn.jar or
commons-logging-api-nn.jar is deployed in a container classpath, then this
adapters-only jar file should be deployed in the webapp, not the complete Commons
Logging distribution. This ensures that the core Log/LogFactory classes are only
deployed via one classloader, thus avoiding "Log4JLogger does not implement Log"
and similar problems.

File commons-logging-api-nn.jar provides minimal adapters to external logging
libraries, just the internally implemented SimpleLog and NoOpLog classes
plus Jdk14Logger (which is currently required by Apache Tomcat).

The file commons-logging-api-nn.jar may be used as a declared dependency for
projects that care about "transitive dependencies" and can't handle jar files
such as commons-logging-nn.jar which have "optional" dependencies depending on
how they are used. In addition, this jar file can be useful for "rebundlers" of
Commons Logging who recompile the source-code but who may not be able to
recompile against the full set of supported adapters; such projects should be
able to at least recreate an equivalent of this jar file.

== General Notes ==

The Apache Commons project has migrated to the Subversion version control system
(previously, CVS was used). There should be no effect on users of the Commons
Logging library, but obviously the process of examining the latest source code,
and of creating patches for Commons Logging has now changed. Please see the
Apache Commons website for details (http://commons.apache.org/).

The Apache Commons project has now moved to using the Apache JIRA installation
as its bugtracking system (formerly, the Apache Bugzilla installation was used).

All source files for this release have been updated to reflect the new Apache
Software Foundation licensing rules. The terms and conditions are unaltered;
this merely affects how those are presented in the source files. See
  http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html

This release can be built/tested with Maven 2.0.x as well as Ant. Note that
building with Maven 1.x is no longer supported. The files used to build Commons
Logging with Maven 1.x will be removed in a future version of Commons Logging.

== Bugs Fixed ==

* LOGGING-106: Commons Logging 1.1 was completely unusable under a security
  policy that prevented access to system properties. Even signing/authorising
  the Commons Logging library was not sufficient. This has been fixed by (a)
  catching SecurityException and falling back to a sensible default, and (b)
  using AccessController so Commons Logging can be granted privileges without
  needing the caller to have them too.

* LOGGING-107: Commons Logging 1.1 auto-discovery failed under a security
  policy that prevented calls to ClassLoader.getParent. Signing/authorising the
  Commons Logging library was not sufficient as an AccessController was not used.
  This has been fixed by catching SecurityException and using an AccessController.

* LOGGING-111, LOGGING-114: Show the contents of chained exceptions, to make
  debugging easier, in particular when using Commons Logging together with Log4J.

* LOGGING-113: pom.xml in maven repository does not list dependencies as optional.

* LOGGING-115: NPE thrown due to exception message logging.

* LOGGING-117: Unit tests fail on linux with java16.

* LOGGING-118: Generate source and binary archives.

* MEV-392 (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MEV-392)
  As Commons Logging didn't provide a Maven2 pom.xml file, one was helpfully
  created by people not involved with the commons-logging project and published
  to the standard maven repositories. Unfortunately this pom declared normal
  dependencies on all the logging libraries that are supported by the core
  Commons Logging distribution, meaning they all get pulled into a project that
  declares a dependency on Commons Logging 1.1. This release now provides an
  "official" pom.xml which declares these dependencies as optional so they aren't
  automatically included in projects that depend on Commons Logging 1.1.1.

* (no bug#): Fix thread-safety bug (SimpleDateFormat.format is not thread-safe).
  Thanks to Martin Wilson of bright-interactive for the bug report.

* (no bug#): Security issue regarding access to context classloader (see
  incompatibilities section above).

DEPRECATIONS:
============

    (These are carried forward from Version 1.0.4)

[LogSource]        Previously deprecated, replaced by LogFactory.
