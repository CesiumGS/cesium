# Box Textured with Property Attributes

This is a variation on BoxTextured that adds EXT_structural_metadata to put matrices and normalized vectors at each vertex. This model is quite contrived; it was designed for unit testing only.

## Metadata Generation Code

The metadata buffer was generated by the following Python 3 script. The only dependency is NumPy for easy exporting of matrices.

In the `glTF` subdirectory:

```powershell
python3 make_box_textured_metadata.py
```

will generate `metadata.bin`.
