		<h1>Full Screen Plugin details</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>The Fullscreen plugin provides an extra button on the toolbar to allow switching the
				editor into 'full screen' mode, meaning the editor takes over the viewport of the
				browser.   This plugin is particularly useful when editing large documents.</li>
			<li>The mode can also be toggled by entering the key command: CTRL-SHIFT-F11
				in the editor pane.</li>
			<li>When it toggled to full screen, it makes
				the editor text pane opaque white so that the contents behind it are not visible.</li>
			<li>When in full screen mode, the plugin attempts to capture the TAB key and allow navigation only between
				the editor toolbar and the editing area, as when in full screen mode, the rest of the page is hidden
				behind the editor.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Things to test:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Verify that clicking the full screen icon highlights the button appropriately and toggles the full screen mode on.</li>
			<li>Verify that clicking the full screen icon again dehighlites the button and toggles the full screen mode off.</li>
			<li>Click in the editing pane and verify that CTRL-SHIFT-F11 toggles the full screen mode on and off.</li>
			<li>Verify while in full screen mode that TAB seems to behave appropriately.  Please note that FireFox and Internet
				Explorer work the best here.  There are still a few tab control issues in Safari and Chrome.</li>
