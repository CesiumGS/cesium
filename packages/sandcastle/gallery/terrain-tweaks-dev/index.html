If a tile has too many loading descendants, that tile will be loaded and rendered before any of its descendants are loaded and rendered. This means more feedback for the user that something is happening at the cost of a longer overall load time. Setting this to 0 will cause each tile level to be loaded successively, significantly increasing load time. Setting it to a large number (e.g. 100000) will minimize the number of tiles that are loaded but tend to make detail appear all at once after a long wait."
